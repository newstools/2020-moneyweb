South African Breweries (SAB) is cancelling R5 billion ($290 million) of planned investments over the revenue losses it has suffered due the near 3-month coronavirus ban on alcohol sales, the brewer said in a statement on Monday. “The cancellation of this planned expenditure is a direct consequence of having lost 12 full trading weeks, which effectively equates to some 30% of SAB’s annual production,” said the firm’s vice-president of finance Andrew Murray.
