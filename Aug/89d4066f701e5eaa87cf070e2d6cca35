South Africaâ€™s main stock index erases gains of as much as 0.4% to fall 0.5% by 9:40am in Johannesburg, as weakness in banks and MTN Group counter a rise in heavyweight BHP and a soaring Shoprite. The losses come amid a resurgence in Covid-19 cases in parts of the US and Europe, raising concern that the economic rebound is stalling. Risk appetite has also taken a hit amid the ratcheting up of US-China tensions, with the Trump administration expected to unveil new measures shortly against Chinese-owned software deemed to pose national-security risks.
