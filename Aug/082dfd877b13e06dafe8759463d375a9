The Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) will continue to process new claims for benefits offered in terms of the Covid-19 Temporary Employer/Employee Relief Scheme (Ters) for April and May until a cut-off date is announced. The final date on which applications can be submitted will be announced 14 days ahead of time. In a statement released on Monday, the Department of Employment and Labour  said the decision is in line with an agreement reached between itself and the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) social partners. The department said the UIF has been “working tirelessly” to ensure that all valid Covid-19 Ters benefit claims for April, May and June are settled as it gears up to open the system for the new extended benefit period of six weeks ending on August 15. Submission challenges It noted that there have been numerous challenges around the application process and says it will issue a detailed set of frequently asked questions (FAQs) to guide employers. In order to reduce the number of outstanding claims the fund is re-running updates on declarations on the system twice a week and is making payments every day except Sunday to fast-track outstanding claims. According to UIF Commissioner Teboho Maruping: “The fund is also working on a number of front-end adjustments to the system to enable applicants to fix some of the errors on their own, which will greatly ease the load on our side and improve the flow.” Read: UIF payment system tightened, hence delays The fund has made this the responsibility of the client because of its sensitive nature –  but most importantly, says Maruping, it “removes the potential of our officials meddling with client’s private information.” As the fund prepares to open the system for Ters benefit claims for July and August, it has paid out R37 billion for 693 561 applications, benefiting 8.3 million workers.
