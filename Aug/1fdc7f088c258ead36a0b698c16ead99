Oil held near a five-month high as Hurricane Laura disrupts production and refining in the US Gulf. Futures in New York were steady near $43 a barrel. Laura made landfall early Thursday at Cameron, Louisiana, near the border with Texas, as a Category 4 storm. While the hurricane’s path shifted away from refineries and ports in the Houston area, traders are waiting to assess the full extent of the damage and its potential impact on fuel consumption. More than 80% of oil output in the Gulf of Mexico and almost 3 million barrels of a day of refining capacity has been shut ahead of Laura’s landfall, causing a spike in US gasoline prices earlier this week. It’s also disrupting energy flows, with trans-Atlantic shipping rates rising and more than 60 oil and refined product tankers in the western US Gulf waiting for the storm to pass, according to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Whilst the US hurricane season does pose acute bullish near-term price risks, they are not game changing per se with their ramifications being short-lived,” said Ehsan Khoman, head of MENA research at MUFG Bank. Production curtailments due to Laura have driven headline crude prices in recent days, he said. The hurricane is likely to have only a temporary market impact, with Covid-19 continuing to cloud the prospects for a more sustainable recovery in oil prices. There are indication of the weakness everywhere with Norway’s Equinor ASA the latest to announce job cuts. India’s annual fuel demand is expected to drop to a five-year low.
