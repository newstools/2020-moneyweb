Equities rose globally alongside US index futures after President Donald Trump said he’s considering a tax cut on capital gains. Gold slipped for a third day. From carmakers to energy stocks, a broad rally swept the Stoxx Europe 600 Index higher. Momentum carried forward from Asia, where a benchmark gained the most in a week, and from the US, after coronavirus hospitalisations fell in the most populous states even as global cases topped 20 million. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures rose, putting the benchmark on course to approach its all-time high from February. The dollar slipped after just two days of gains against its major peers. The euro gained versus the greenback before the release of Germany’s ZEW survey. Treasuries and core European bonds edged lower. The risk-on sentiment weighed on gold.  Investors are taking some comfort from Trump’s comment on potential tax cuts, strong Chinese economic data and falling hospitalisations in California and New York. Looking past the accelerating rate of global infections, they’re driving a global stocks benchmark toward erasing its 2020 loss today. “Equity has never looked cheaper compared to fixed income and the like,” Jun Bei Liu, portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners, said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “If you want any return, any yield, any income or even any growth you have to go to equities.” Here are some key events coming up: These are the main moves in markets: © 2020 Bloomberg
