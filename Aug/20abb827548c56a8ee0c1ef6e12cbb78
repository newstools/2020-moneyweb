Pick n Pay Clothing patrons will now be able to shop from the comfort of home. The retail clothing store launched its online shop on Monday, allowing customers to view its full clothing range, and have their purchases delivered to their doorstep within a week, for R60. Customers will also earn Smart Shopper points on purchases. This is a separate website to the retailer’s online grocery and general merchandise platform.

Our new website means that more customers will be able to view the great range and styles we have in store, but also lets customers order the items online for safe delivery within days,” says Pick ‘n Pay General manager Hazel Pillay. She adds that there are plans in the pipeline to offer clothing customers a greater range and more convenience, including the launch of a Click n Collect service. How to shop Customers can visit the site here and those with an existing Pick n Pay online profile can log in with those details, or else register. Customers can visit their nearest Pick ‘n Pay Clothing, supermarket or hypermarket store to return or exchange clothing.
