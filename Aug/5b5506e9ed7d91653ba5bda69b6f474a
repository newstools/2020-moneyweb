Eskom has announced that it will implement Stage 2 load shedding from 16:00 until 22:00 on Tuesday, and again from 09:00 until 22:00 on Wednesday this week, as the power system is severely constrained. It said that six generators were returned to service at Medupi, Tutuka, Kendal, Majuba and Grootvlei power stations on Monday. “However, the breakdown of four units overnight and this morning at Medupi, Duvha, Majuba, and Lethabo power stations, as well as a delay in the expected return to service of a unit at Medupi has resulted in the power system being constrained.” If there is any further deterioration in the generation performance, load shedding may escalate “at short notice,” it added. “As the aged generation infrastructure is unreliable and volatile, this constrained power system is expected to persist for the rest of the week, particularly as the cold front hots. “Unplanned breakdowns stand at more than 11 900MW of capacity , adding to the 4 350MW currently out on planned maintenance,” Eskom added. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research recently said load shedding experienced in 2020 has overtaken 2019 levels. Read: Load shedding pushes past 2019 levels – CSIR
