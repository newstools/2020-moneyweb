The Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) will open and begin processing applications for July and August Covid-19 Temporary Employer-Employee Relief Scheme (Ters) benefits from Monday (August 17). This comes after Employment and Labour Minister Thulas Nxesi authorised that the claims be processed next week. In addition, September 15 has been announced as the cut-off date for applications for April and May benefits. The new directives cover employees whose employers are: UIF Commissioner Teboho Maruping says it is important to note that the application process remains the same. “As with previous claim processes, to apply in the new period, employers are required to upload similar documentation that includes a signed approval or acceptance letter, bank confirmation letter, proof of payment to employees and refund to the UIF – if applicable,” he says. Vigilance “In keep[ing] with strict governance principles, we will still subject payments to bank verification prior to releasing the funds into the applicant’s accounts.” Maruping says the experiences of the past have taught the department that even during the pandemic, “criminals are at large and looking to benefit through their nefarious means” and that the department has an obligation to do everything in its power to ensure that funds are not paid into incorrect accounts. He says the UIF will issue a letter to employers who have applied for Ters benefits outlining the process to be followed when making applications for the extension period. It will also update the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document to serve as a quick reference for applicants. All new applications for these periods must be uploaded on or before the cut-off date to qualify for processing and payment, while existing claims will remain open for corrections and finalisation beyond this date.
