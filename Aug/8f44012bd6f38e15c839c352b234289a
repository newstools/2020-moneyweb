South Africaâ€™s Sun International said on Tuesday it would swing to a loss in the six months to June 30 after it was forced to close its operations due to a coronavirus lockdown. The casino and hotel company said its headline loss per share for the period would be between 220 cents and 245 cents per share, verses a headline earnings per share of 128 cents a year earlier. Headline earnings per share is the main profit measure in South Africa.
