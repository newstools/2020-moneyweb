The rand firmed against the dollar on Tuesday, as market sentiment improved after a coronavirus-induced lockdown was lifted over the weekend, while a weaker US currency also helped the local unit. At 1500 GMT, the rand traded at R17.33 per dollar, 0.97% stronger than its previous close. “Buying sentiment towards the local currency has been stimulated by a sweeping removal of lockdown restrictions over the weekend, while dollar weakness continues to support upside gains,” said Lukman Otunuga, senior research analyst at FXTM. “The USDZAR has found resistance below R17.50. A broadly weaker dollar could drag prices back towards R17.15 in the short term,” Otunuga added. The US dollar fell against a basket of major currencies for a fifth consecutive trading day on Tuesday, reaching its lowest level in over two years, under pressure from low yields and bleak economic data in the United States.
