Nestle SA agreed to buy Aimmune Therapeutics in a $2.6 billion deal, adding a leader in the treatment of peanut allergies as demand for mainstream consumer goods eases. The Swiss owner of Nespresso will pay $34.50 a share for the US biotech firm, almost triple its market value. Nestle has been expanding its health-science arm while shedding slower-growing businesses in areas such as ice cream and sweets. Aimmune makes a new treatment called Palforzia designed to help reduce allergic reactions to peanuts in children and teens by exposing them to small doses over time. It was approved earlier this year by the US Food and Drug Administration. Including a 26% stake that Nestle’s health-science arm already holds in Aimmune, the deal has an enterprise value of about $2.6 billion, the Swiss company said in statement. The price represents a 174% premium to Aimmune’s Friday close. Nestle Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider has been overhauling the company with deals, including selling its US confectionery operations and placing its US ice cream business in a joint venture with private equity firm PAI Partners. Nestle bolstered its cash pile with a $10 billion sale of its skin health business earlier this year. Schneider has been less aggressive on the acquisition trail, though he has identified health as a growth area. Nestle acquired Canadian supplements maker Atrium Innovations three years ago in a $2.3 billion deal. Nestle has also focused on expansion in coffee, splashing out $7.2 billion on the right to market Starbucks products, including coffee capsules for the Nespresso system. Nestle said it expects the Aimmune deal, which will be financed with cash on hand, to close in the fourth quarter. (Updates with other deals)
