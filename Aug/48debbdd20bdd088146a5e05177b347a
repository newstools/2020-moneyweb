South Africa’s main stock index climbs 1.6% by 9:43 a.m. in Johannesburg as gains in diversified miners and a rally in Richemont counters weakness in index giant Naspers. It’s the market’s first trading session of the week following Monday’s holiday. Sasol reverses earlier weakness to be 0.9% higher. Stock retreated as much as 3.1% after the company said it expects to swing to losses after write downs on US chemical assets contributed to R112 billion of charges and oil prices declined. South African stocks joins peers in Asia and Europe in rising, as risk sentiment is boosted by a drop in coronavirus hospitalisations in some US states, and by strong Chinese economic data.  © 2020 Bloomberg
