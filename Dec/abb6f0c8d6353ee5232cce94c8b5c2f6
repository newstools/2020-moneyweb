The digital asset was little changed at about $19,232 as of 8:42 a.m. in London on Wednesday. This week, Bitcoin surpassed its all-time high from December 2017 and reached $19,914 before weakening again.

Traders may be taking profits but institutions are keen to buy when the cryptocurrency dips, he added.  Bitcoin is up about 165% this year, a climb some ascribe to a widening investor base and growing appetite for new ways of diversifying portfolios amid expectations of ongoing dollar weakness. While the level of recent selling “comes as a slight surprise,” other indicators point to “near and longer-term upward momentum,” said Ryan Rabaglia, global head of trading at OSL brokerage in Hong Kong. Gary Cohn, a former economic chief to President Donald Trump, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television this week that Bitcoin “lacks some of the basic integrity of a real market,” underscoring ongoing skepticism over the surge in digital assets in 2020.
