BlackBerry trading volume was more than 70 times the daily average.

Amazon Web Services is the largest provider of rented computing power and software services and has reshaped how companies of all sizes buy technology. The Amazon.com Inc. unit has made an aggressive push in recent years to get automakers to use its cloud-computing tools as the digital plumbing behind their connected cars, or for their manufacturing efforts.
