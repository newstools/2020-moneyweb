I am planning to move my pension to a preservation fund, since I have been retrenched. I have not made a decision yet regarding which institution to select or how to diversify my portfolio. Could you please assist?  Dear reader, You are definitely making the right decision – preserving your pension fund is the best way to ensure that you keep your retirement savings on track. When deciding which provider to choose, it is important to know what providers can and cannot offer you. All the product providers are subject to the same regulatory framework, so there are some characteristics of your preservation fund that will be the same, irrespective of which provider you choose. Firstly, let’s cover the main features of a pension preservation fund that are not flexible: * You may receive up to R500 000 free of tax from your total combined retirement savings during your lifetime. Now let us look at the important things you need to establish before choosing a product provider: With all of the above in mind, we would be hesitant to name a particular product provider as ‘the best’, because it is very dependent on your personal needs. We strongly encourage that you speak to a financial advisor before selecting not only the product provider but, more importantly, when you need to select your underlying investment funds. Choosing to preserve your benefit was the first step in the right direction and selecting one product provider over another could possibly impact your investment outcome. But being invested in the wrong underlying funds will definitely stop you from reaching your retirement goals.
