The leaked data relates to a small portion of Absa South Africa’s customer base, although investigations continue,” it said. The bank did not immediately say what type of information was handed over. It did not say when the leak happened.“Upon discovering the contravention, Absa secured high court orders that enabled search and seizure operations at various premises and secured all devices containing the data. The data on these devices was subsequently destroyed,” the bank added. Enhanced monitoring
“Absa has enhanced the monitoring of customer accounts that have been affected to date and is contacting customers directly,” it said. “Absa has brought criminal charges against the employee, and internally the requisite consequence management has been undertaken. “Absa may take further action in relation to the recipients of the data once the full scope of the leak is identified and all investigations are completed.”  — (c) 2020 NewsCentral Media Duncan McLeod is Editor of TechCentral.
