Chemicals group Sasol has sold its Mozambique gas- to-power plant Central Termica De Ressano Garcia S.A. (CTRG) to Azura Power for $145 million (R2.1 billion). In a statement, Sasol says this transaction is part of its “ongoing, strategy aligned, asset divestment programme.” The disposal of CTRG follows its sale of a 50% stake in its newly-completed Lake Charles Chemicals Project in Louisiana, for $2 billion to LyondellBasell, a global chemicals and plastics producer a few weeks ago.
