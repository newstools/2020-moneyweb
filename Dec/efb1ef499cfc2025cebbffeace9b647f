Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk had predicted only about a one-third chance of success for the initial flight of SN8, Space Exploration Technologies Corp.’s futuristic design prototype. The company has made steady progress over the past year on Starship prototypes at its factory in Boca Chica, Texas. The Starship was attempting to reach about 41,000 feet (12,500 meters) in the test, also the first flight for SpaceX’s newest Raptor engine. SpaceX also was collecting data on how the vehicle could flip and orient for a powered landing similar to the process for the company’s workhorse Falcon 9 system.
