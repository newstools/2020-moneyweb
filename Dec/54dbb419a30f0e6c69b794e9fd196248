South Africa’s Tongaat Hulett on Wednesday said it expects to swing to an interim headline profit of as much as R189 million ($12.37 million) driven by a turnaround at its local operations, sending the sugar producer’s shares higher. Tongaat said headline earnings for the six-months ended September 30 will surge by between 150% to 160%, or to between R158 million  and R189 million, from a loss of R315 million during the same period a year earlier.

The agriculture and agri-processing company has sold assets, cut jobs and sought an equity raise to boost cash flow amid high debt levels. The company flagged an increase in operating profit of around 70% for the period compared to the R1.3 billion generated a year earlier on the back of a good performance from its sugar operations and progress in its turnaround strategy. However, higher finance costs and a monetary loss arising from hyperinflation in Zimbabwe weighed on operating profit, the company said. Tongaat said total borrowing fell by around R900 million to R10.9 billion from R11.8 billion a year ago. The interim results are expected to be released on December, 11.
