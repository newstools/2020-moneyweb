It is something of a tradition to take stock at this time of the year and reflect on what has happened during the past 12 months. However, given the mixed emotions 2020 has engendered, it can be tempting to gloss over the negatives in an effort to put them behind us, and then move swiftly to how we hope next year will be different without reflecting on any positives that may have emerged this year. Despite some of the sharpest declines we have witnessed in markets and prolonged volatility, there were some positives for patient (and bold) investors. We have always maintained that some of the best investments are made at the times of greatest discomfort, and 2020 may well turn out to be one of those times.

At the end of a trying year, it’s worth reflecting on at least three positive investment surprises 2020 has brought us. Keep a ‘bigger picture’ perspective to see the opportunities others miss 2020 has been intense, uncertain and noisy. However, despite the uncertainty, there have still been positive surprises that have seen outcomes shape up differently than most investors had expected. As we head into the new year, it’s worth reminding ourselves that we never know with credible certainty what any new year will bring. However, keeping a cool head and maintaining a bigger picture perspective helps us to overcome the risk of emotional decision-making, and also allows us to focus on exploiting the potential opportunities we find.
