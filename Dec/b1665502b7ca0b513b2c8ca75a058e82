The US firm’s vaccine candidate is one of at least four Covid vaccines being trialled in South Africa, along with candidates being developed by Novavax, AstraZeneca and Pfizer. Semete told a news conference the regulator would focus on “safety, quality and efficacy” of any coronavirus vaccine used in the country of around 58 million as it fast-tracks vaccine approvals. South Africa, which officially entered a second wave of infections last week, has more than 860,000 infections and 23,000 deaths, and is the worst-hit country in the continent.
