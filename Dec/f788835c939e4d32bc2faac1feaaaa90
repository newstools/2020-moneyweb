In the tough times of 2020, I’ve found myself drawn to nonfiction that made me look at the familiar in a different way. I’ve collected my favorite 15 books of the year here (technically, two were published in 2019, but I didn’t get around to reading them until this year). The first 14 are in random order, followed by my pick for the best nonfiction book of the year. And my pick as best nonfiction book of the year: Subscribe for full access to all our share and unit trust data tools, our award-winning articles, and support quality journalism in the process.
