The current account recorded a surplus of 5.9% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the third quarter from a deficit of 2.9% of GDP in the previous three months. As a percentage of GDP, the surplus was the highest since the third quarter of 1988. The rand value of the current account surplus – at R297.5 billion ($19.88 billion) in the third quarter – was more than four times the size of the previous largest surplus of R63.4 billion, recorded in the first quarter of 2020. The trade balance showed a wider surplus of R453.58 billion in the July-September quarter, versus a R71.40 billion surplus in the previous three months. “South Africa’s export volumes bounced back in the third quarter of 2020 in step with global trade, following the easing of Covid-19 lockdown restrictions and the related rebound in economic activity,” the central bank said in a statement. “The improvement in the trade balance resulted from the value of merchandise exports increasing substantially more than imports.”
