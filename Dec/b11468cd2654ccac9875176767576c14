While the National Treasury has set aside R10.5 billion to help get the carrier flying again, efforts to resuscitate it have been hobbled by the Covid-19 pandemic and a resultant decline in demand for air travel. “Funding made available by government is limited and focused on restructuring South African Airways and restarting operations at the airline and subsidiaries,” the department said. “The availability of these funds is a product of government having had to do some belt-tightening to make the restructuring possible.” Three of the main unions representing SAA workers — the National Union of Metalworkers’ of South Africa, the South African Cabin Crew Association and the South African Pilots’ Association rejected the state’s pay settlement offer.
