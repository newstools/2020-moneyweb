Coca-Cola Co is cutting 2 200 jobs worldwide, including 1 200 in the US, as the soda maker deepens its restructuring efforts amid ongoing shutdowns of soft-drink friendly venues like movie theatres, bars and stadiums. The reductions, totalling 2.5% of the company’s total workforce, involve a combination of voluntary buyouts and layoffs, a spokesman said Thursday via email. Coke had about 86 200 employees at the beginning of the year, including 10 400 in the US.

It said then that involuntary cuts would follow. Like other makers of sugary beverages, Coke is navigating changing consumer tastes, as products such as flavoured seltzers gain in popularity, along with extended shutdowns of public venues that account for a significant portion of its sales. The workforce overhaul will result in expenses of $350 million to $550 million, the company said. Coke said that annual savings will be a similar amount. The company’s shares rose less than 1% in New York trading on Thursday. The stock has declined 3.8% this year, trailing the broader market.
