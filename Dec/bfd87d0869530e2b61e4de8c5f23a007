The rand had been battered this week as countries around the world closed their borders to both Britain and South Africa following their identification of new, fast-spreading variants of the coronavirus. But it held firm even as US stock futures fell, commodities slipped and Treasuries edged higher after President Donald Trump threatened at the last minute to derail a long-awaited pandemic relief bill.

At 0553 GMT, the dollar index was slightly weaker at 90.448. Government bonds were flat, with the yield on the instrument due in 2030 at 8.760%.
