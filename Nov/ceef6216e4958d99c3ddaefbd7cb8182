For perspective on how frenetic the U.S. equity market has been in 2020, consider share volume on Thanksgiving eve. In what passes for a relatively light session of late, almost 11 billion shares changed hands during Wednesday’s session, 6% below the pandemic-era average.

Along with surging megacaps, high volatility and, recently, the reemergence of reopening plays, super-high volume has been a hallmark of the pandemic trading scene.

While volume historically thins around the holidays, traders say the new work-from-home normal has upended that and many have become glued to their screens amid heavy news flow. Retail investor activity has also picked up, with mom-and-pop traders now accounting for a fifth of equity trading volume, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. “It’s a lot easier to trade today than prior years,” said Ben Axler, founder and chief investment officer of Spruce Point Capital Management. “People are grounded and not in airplanes and are staying close to home.” © 2020 Bloomberg
