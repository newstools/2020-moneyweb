Musk, 49, is poised to become the world’s third-richest person, leapfrogging Mark Zuckerberg, after his net worth swelled by more than $15 billion in extended trading. Tesla, whose stock closed at $408.09, surged about 14% at 6:20 p.m. in New York, lifting Musk’s net worth to $117.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His wealth has jumped $90 billion this year, the biggest gain on the ranking of the world’s 500 richest people. Tesla will enter the S&P 500 on December 21 following months of speculation, and one temporary setback, after the stock failed to make the cut during the index’s quarterly rebalancing in early September.

On Saturday, Musk tweeted that he “most likely” had a moderate case of Covid-19 and has had symptoms of “a minor cold.” Sunday he tweeted he had no symptoms.
