Google announced its plans to buy Fitbit for $2.1 billion in November 2019, noting that it would use the smartwatch maker to improve its lagging hardware business. The deal has faced criticism and regulatory scrutiny in Europe and the US. Earlier this month, the US Department of Justice sued Google parent Alphabet for abusing antitrust laws. Google has previously said it planned for the Fitbit deal to close in 2020. On Wednesday, Fitbit said in a filing that the completion date for the merger was extended until February of 2021.
