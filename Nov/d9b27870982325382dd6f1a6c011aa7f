In all four states, Biden was seen as the more empathetic candidate and the one more able to unify the country. An ABC/Washington Post poll had less good news for Biden, showing Trump narrowly ahead in Florida, 50%-48%. The same poll had Biden well ahead, 51%-44% in Pennsylvania. Emerson College released battleground state polls that showed Biden up in Michigan, but the race in Ohio and Iowa within the margin of error and essentially tied. While these polls show Biden running better than Hillary Clinton did four years ago, analysts say Trump still has a narrow but viable path to an election win through the states considered “toss ups” by nonpartisan election handicappers. National polls cannot indicate a winner, since presidents are chosen by state, but they can suggest trends. An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showed Biden up a full 10 percentage points, 52% to 42% for Trump. His lead was built by support from Black voters, 87%-5%; young voters, 60%-32% for Trump; seniors, 58%-35%; women 57% to 37%; White voters with college degrees, 56% to 41%; and independents, 51% to 36%. A CBS News poll showed that Biden has support from 66% of those who’ve already voted to 32% who backed Trump. The breakdown of early voting in person versus through the mail was not indicated.
