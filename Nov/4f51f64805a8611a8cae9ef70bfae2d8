Zimbabwe’s largest teachers union’s members refused to return to work in September because they were not being paid enough. Surging inflation and changes to the nation’s currency regime have eroded the value of teachers’ salaries to between $30 and $35 a month, the Zimbabwe Teachers Association said in an email at the time. The body wanted members to be paid $520 plus sector-specific allowances. They will now earn Z$18,237 ($223). The lowest paid civil servant will receive a salary of Z$14,528. Annual inflation in Zimbabwe is currently at 471%. The country is facing shortages of foreign currency and half the population of almost 15 million people is estimated to be in need of food aid.
