The rand had risen on Tuesday as appetite for riskier assets grew after US President Donald Trump accepted the start of a transition to a Joe Biden presidency. CPI data is due around 0800 GMT and is expected to show a slight pickup in consumer inflation in October to 3.1% in annual terms, from 3.0% in the previous month. Those modest readings are comfortable for the central bank, which has a target range of between 3% and 6%. The central bank kept its main lending rate on hold last week at 3.5%, and one of its deputy governors said this week that a full economic recovery from the effects of Covid-19 was likely to be “slow and difficult”. Government bonds were little changed in early deals, with the yield on the 2030 instrument at 8.855%.
