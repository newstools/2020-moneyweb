I would like to save for retirement with a retirement annuity (RA) plan, but I do not know how to pick the correct one. Please advise on what to look out for when choosing which company to go with and the type of plan to choose.  Please note that the information provided below does not constitute financial advice; in fact, we are precluded from giving specific advice. Generic information has been applied given the context of your question. We have limited details about you and your circumstances – such detail may impact any advice provided. One of the hardest parts of saving is the initial commitment; well done on taking the first step. It is unclear whether you are going to make a lump sum contribution or have a debit order. There is no right or wrong answer here but my feeling is that for this type of investment a debit order provides a good foundation and you can then make ad hoc top-ups too if you are able to (both practically and within legislative tax-deductible contribution allowances). Here’s a retirement annuity 101 for any readers who are rusty on the basics: I can’t advise you on which product to go for because I don’t know enough about your financial situation, but a financial advisor can help you figure this out. When it comes to choosing your platform though, you should look out for the following attributes: Thankfully there are a couple of providers out there who match all these criteria. In closing, I would like to wish you good luck. If this is your only investment you want to explore splitting across other products, such as a tax-free savings account, to get product, liquidity and tax diversification.
