The rand climbed to a six-week best on Tuesday as demand for risk assets was lifted by renewed hopes for a Covid-19 vaccine and solid industrial and retail data from China. At 1500 GMT the rand was 1.44% firmer at R16.43 per dollar, its best level since July 27, having closed overnight at R16.67. “This seems to be a purely technical washout below the 200 day MA support level,” said a trader at IG Warren Venketas. The rand has struggled for weeks to break the 200 daily moving average (DMA) around R16.56 in volatile but range bound trade driven mostly by external events, although further signs of a ailing local economy spooked skittish investors. “Chinese industrial output data initiated the initial risk appetite but technicals sourced further rand strength,” the trader added. China’s industrial output accelerated and retail sales grew for the first time this year, beating analysts’ forecasts, signalling a recovery in the world’s no.1 economy. Vaccine hopes have also crept back into markets.
