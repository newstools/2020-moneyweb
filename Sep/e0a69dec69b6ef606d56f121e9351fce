Eskom said on Thursday it was on track to install six new steam generators at its Koeberg nuclear power plant in 2021 as planned, with the first in transit and expected to arrive in Cape Town later this month. The R4.3 billion ($258 million) project, which was unsuccessfully challenged in court by Westinghouse following its award to then French rival Areva, is seen as crucial for South African attempts to prolong Koebergâ€™s operations.
