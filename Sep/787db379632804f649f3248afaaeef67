South Africa’s main stock benchmark retreated for a third day Thursday, falling 1.6% by 9:35 a.m. in Johannesburg, the biggest intraday decline in two weeks. Tech investor giant Naspers led the losses after a tech selloff in the US and Asia overnight, while miners were weaker after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell highlighted uncertainty about the economic rebound. The risk-off sentiment overshadowed optimism spurred by a further easing of coronavirus restrictions in South Africa announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa on Wednesday evening. Investor focus will be on the outcome of the South African Reserve Bank’s monetary policy committee meeting later Thursday. Nine of the 17 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the Sarb to cut the repo rate by 25bps to 3.25%, while eight see rates on hold.
