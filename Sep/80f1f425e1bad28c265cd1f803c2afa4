South Africa’s main stock index slid 0.7% as of 2:19 p.m. in Johannesburg as local market giant Naspers bore the brunt of a global rout in tech shares, outweighing a rebound in banks and resurgent gold miners. The benchmark index is on course for its worst week since March after falling 3.4% since Monday. A rotation by investors out of the world’s high-flying tech shares saw China’s Tencent lead Hong Kong equities lower for a second day in Hong Kong, pulling Naspers, which holds a 31% stake in Tencent through its Prosus NV unit, down 3.6% to a two-week low. Prosus itself tumbled 3.5%. Luxury retailer Richemont retreated 1.7% to be the second-biggest decliner by index points.  An index of gold stocks snapped three days of losses, climbing 2.4% as gold rose and the dollar steadied ahead of the release of the key monthly US jobs report Friday. Index of bank stocks climbs for the first day in three, rising 2.1%.
