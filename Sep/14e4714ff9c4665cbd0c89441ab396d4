The group’s declared dividend thus far for its 2020 financial year is 106 cents per share (which is linked to its half-year results). Conspicuously it notes in a short-form results JSE Sens announcement on Wednesday morning that “dividend declared decreased by 51.4% to 106.0 cents per share compared to 218.1 cents per share for the comparative period”. Growthpoint had predicted flat Dividend Per Share (DPS) growth before the pandemic hit in March, due to the country’s economy already being in recession. DPS has traditionally been one of the key financial metrics on which local Reits are measured. “As a precautionary measure to provide the group with additional financial flexibility and bolster its liquidity in unprecedented market conditions as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the board of directors resolved to defer its decision on a final dividend payment for the year ended 30 June 2020 until December 2020 or an earlier date to be determined by the board,” Growthpoint said in a short-form JSE Sens announcement on Wednesday morning. The group is set to host results presentations with listed property sector analysts and media later on Wednesday.
