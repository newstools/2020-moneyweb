Tesla plans to sell as much as $5 billion of shares, capitalising on its high-flying stock and on a recent share split that made it more accessible to retail investors. The carmaker will sell the shares “from time to time” through an agreement with several banks, according to a regulatory filing. Before the new offering, Elon Musk’s company had raised about $14 billion over the past decade through secondary stock offerings, most recently with a $2 billion sale in February. The sales have helped bolster the company’s cash during its transition from a niche electric car maker to the mass market. Tesla shares were up 2.1% in early trading, paring earlier gains after the share sale was disclosed in a filing. The stock has climbed almost 500% this year on a split-adjusted basis.
