South African state arms firm Denel faces the risk of being placed under a local form of bankruptcy protection called business rescue or even liquidation, the National Treasury said on Tuesday. Denel, which makes military equipment for South Africaâ€™s armed forces and clients around the world, has struggled to pay salaries this year amid a liquidity crisis aggravated by the coronavirus crisis. National Treasury said in a presentation to parliament that Denel was forecast to have had a negative equity position of R3.3 billion ($196.7 million) as of March 2020.
