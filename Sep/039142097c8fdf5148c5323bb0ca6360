South Africa’s power utility rationed electricity for a second day Wednesday and warned outages may worsen due to breakdowns at key generation units. Eskom Holdings said it’s cutting 2 000 megawatts from the grid between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m., continuing with rolling blackouts that are adding to the woes facing the Africa’s most-industrialised economy. Eskom, which is saddled with R450 billion of debt, blamed failures in 10 generation units at seven power stations for the disruptions, known locally as load shedding. “There is a high probability that additional stages of load shedding may be implemented at short notice,” the utility said. #PowerAlert 2Eskom to continue implementing Stage 2 #Loadshedding from 08:00 until 22:00 tomorrow as power system is still severely constrained pic.twitter.com/JfuYcWxAyD — Eskom Hld SOC Ltd (@Eskom_SA) September 1, 2020  Read: Eskom’s Majuba power station rail project debacle Dealing with the elephant in the room that is Eskom © 2020 Bloomberg
