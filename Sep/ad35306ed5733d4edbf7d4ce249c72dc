South Africa’s foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows fell to R17.4 billion in the second quarter from R29 billion in the first quarter, the central bank said on Tuesday. The FDI inflows in the three months to end June were due to foreign parent companies providing mainly debt funding to South African subsidiaries, the South African Reserve Bank said in its September Quarterly Bulletin. Portfolio investments including bonds and shares registered outflows R54.8 billion in the second quarter compared to outflows of R97.6 billion in first quarter. “Portfolio investment flows largely reflected non-resident net sales of South African debt securities, as well as the redemption of international bonds by national government,” the Reserve Bank said. “This was partly countered by South African residents’ disposal of foreign portfolio assets.” Non-residents disposed of bonds worth R41.7 billion in the second quarter and sold R13.1 billion in equities, the central bank said.
