An unprecedented economic recovery plan set to be unveiled by South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa focuses on fighting graft, encouraging mining investment and boosting infrastructure investment. The plan was negotiated between government, labor unions and business leaders — a first in South Africa — and aims to chart a way out of an economic trough deepened by the coronavirus pandemic and a lockdown to curb its spread.
