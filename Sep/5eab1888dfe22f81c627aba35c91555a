The Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) has extended the applications for the Temporary Employer-Employee Relief Scheme (Ters) to September 15. It says this follows negotiations at the National Economic and Labour Council (Nedlac), and the signing of the direction to that effect by Minister Thulas Nxesi. “With the lockdown for some industries extended to September 15, it only makes sense for us to continue to shield workers from the worst effects of the pandemic by extending the relief payments which have placed much-needed cash into the hands of ordinary workers in this country,” Nxesi says. The benefit is intended to provide relief for the industries whose employer/employees who are still impacted by the Covid-19 induced lockdown as part of the government-wide response to ease the burden of the pandemic and to ensure that workers are not prejudiced by the lockdown. Before companies apply they need to check if they meet the following directives: Nxesi pointed out that the UIF will continue to receive applications for March to end July period until 15 September and no further applications shall be accepted beyond that date. Applications for August to September 15, shall close on October 30, and no further applications shall be accepted beyond that date. To date, the UIF has dispursed R41 billion in 9 501 365 payments through applications by 825 814 employers.
