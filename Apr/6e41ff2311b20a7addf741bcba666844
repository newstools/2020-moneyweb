While the JSE has delivered excellent returns over the past 20 years, given the state of the local economy, with rising debt levels, stagnant growth and political instability, South Africa’s economic outlook looks grim. All of this before we even consider the impact Covid-19 will have on us and the global economic environment. South Africans may be looking beyond the JSE, but are not too sure how to go about it. Globalisation and the evolution of stock market technology and products have pushed the borders of countries aside, freeing up the movement of money across jurisdictions, allowing your portfolio to spread across a more diverse investment universe, all from the comfort of your own home. In this upcoming webinar, Ryan Gordon of Mexem Africa will be briefing listeners on what the platform has to offer to those investors who are interested in accessing offshore markets. This webinar takes place on Tuesday, April 7 at 11:00. You can register here.
