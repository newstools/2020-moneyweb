The rand firmed against the dollar early on Wednesday after President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a R500 billion rescue package on Tuesday evening to cushion the economic blow of the Covid-19 pandemic. At 0620 GMT, the rand traded at 18.93 per dollar, 0.32% firmer than its previous close. Among the measures to fund the rescue package, Ramaphosa said South Africa had approached global financial institutions like the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, the BRICS New Development Bank and the African Development Bank, primarily to fund healthcare interventions. The rest of the package would be financed by a mix of R130 billion of reprioritised spending by the government and other local sources, as well as 200 billion rand in loan guarantees in partnership with the central bank, finance ministry and commercial banks.
