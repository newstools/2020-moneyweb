South Africa will cap losses for banks participating in its R200 billion loan-guarantee programme as the government seeks to rekindle an economy devastated by a lockdown to curb the coronavirus. Lenders, the National Treasury and central bank have created a credit-guarantee programme in which the government and banks will share profits made from the difference between the cost of funding and the rate of interest charged on loans, the Treasury said in an email on Friday. Should the gains not be enough to offset losses, these will be absorbed by banks — up to 6% of the loan, with the government shouldering the rest. The initial phase of the project will target R100 billion of loans that will be offered at a single interest rate that still needs to be determined, and pegged to the central bank’s benchmark rate, the Treasury said. Banks will also be charged a guarantee fee. South Africa is following the lead of other nations around the world seeking to provide stimulus to their economies through their banking systems. The loan guarantees form part of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s R500 billion support package aimed at rekindling growth and helping those worst affected by the lockdown.
