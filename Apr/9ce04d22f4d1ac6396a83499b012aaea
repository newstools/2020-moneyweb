South Africa’s Finance Minister Tito Mboweni told lawmakers on Thursday the government was willing to sell cash-burning state-owned firms to ease pressure on government finances in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and sharply falling tax revenue. The treasury sees gross domestic product slumping by nearly 6% in 2020, while tax receipts are expected to tumble by at least a third. Answering questions during a virtual session to parliament, Mboweni said the government would sell “poorly functioning” state firms, without giving details.
