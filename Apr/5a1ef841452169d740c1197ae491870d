The South African unit of Toyota could see its production drop by around 15-20% in 2020, its president and CEO Andrew Kirby said on Wednesday. The division had already lost production of around 13 500 units due to a nationwide lockdown in South Africa, set to last five weeks, Kirby told a virtual media briefing. Its annual production volume normally stands at around 135 000-150,000 units.
