South Africa’s coronavirus infections increased by 70 cases to 1 655 on Sunday, and a total of 11 deaths have been recorded, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said in an emailed statement. The country’s military health services have called on registered civilian health practitioners to join its members on the ground to help contain the spread of the disease as the country entered its 10th day of a three-week lockdown. It said the operation may continue until June 23. The government expects the number of coronavirus infections to increase as testing is ramped up through a mass screening program which will encompass about 10 000 field workers. They will check up on people in their homes and at mobile testing stations. South Africa has the highest number of confirmed cases on the continent. A total of 56 873 Covid-19 tests have been conducted. Meanwhile, state-owned arms manufacturer Denel has allocated resources and expertise to design and develop medical ventilators locally to increase the capacity of medical equipment to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.
