MTN South Africa has finally reached a consent agreement with the Competition Commission over data prices, more than six weeks after rival Vodacom did the same. The agreement follows what the commission has described as a “protracted discussion” between the parties following the conclusion of the regulator’s data services market inquiry, which was finalised in December. The commission required Vodacom and MTN to implement “substantial and immediate reductions on tariff levels, especially prepaid monthly bundles”, within two months of the report’s publication. Vodacom and the commission concluded a consent agreement on 9 March, which took effect on 1 April after it was ratified by the Competition Tribunal. The MTN agreement has now also been referred to the tribunal. “MTN had already been in negotiations with the commission but was also forced to respond in the market to those price changes and the additional subscriber value provided by Vodacom as anticipated by the commission,” the competition watchdog said in a statement on Thursday. Under the agreement, MTN has undertaken to: “The commission will institute ongoing monitoring of pricing levels and profitability into the future until the market becomes more competitive,” it said.
