Pick n Pay announced on Monday that its customers may now send digital grocery vouchers, allowing others to have access to essential items and encouraging contactless transactions during this time. The giant food and clothing retail store says voucher values range from R50 up to R1 000, and they can be used at Pick n Pay stores nationally. Richard van Rensburg, CIO at Pick n Pay, says that the timing of this new feature is particularly relevant as many customers look to support each other, from a distance. “Many have been separated from their friends, family, domestic workers, staff or colleagues during lockdown. The new digital grocery voucher helps you virtually send essential food items to each other’s homes,” Van Rensburg says. He adds that this new feature will also help customers support a local charity that may need supplies during this difficult time. How it works Early on in April Pick n Pay upped the ante in South Africa’s online retail sector, by launching a same-day grocery delivery service in partnership with alcohol delivery app Bottles. The app has changed tack to deliver essential groceries during the national lockdown. Read: Lockdown: PnP launches same-day grocery delivery
