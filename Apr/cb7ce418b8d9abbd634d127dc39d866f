Malawi’s president declared a 21-day lockdown as Covid-19 continues to spread in the southern African nation, with 16 confirmed cases and two deaths. The lockdown will come into effect on midnight at April 18 until May 9, President Peter Mutharika said in a broadcast on national television Tuesday. He warned the country risks losing as many as 50 000 lives if it doesn’t act with haste and slow the spread of the disease. “As a nation we require about 150 billion kwacha ($205 million) for the implementation of the national Covid-19 preparedness and response plan,” he said. © 2020 Bloomberg
