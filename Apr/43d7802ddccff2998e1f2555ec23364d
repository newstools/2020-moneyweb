 Development partners should consider debt relief over a two- to three-year period for all African nations, the ministers said in a statement following a meeting with the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa. They also want a special purpose vehicle created to deal with all sovereign debt obligations, according to the statement. Last month, the ministers agreed that the continent needs a stimulus package of $100 billion to face the economic crisis wrought by the virus. The package amount includes $44 billion in debt-servicing waivers.
