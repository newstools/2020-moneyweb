The South African Reserve Bank (Sarb) announced a further 100 basis point cut to the repo rate on Tuesday, following an emergency meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in the wake of a worsening economic fallout from the global Covid-19 pandemic. This brings the repo rate down to 4.25%, its lowest level since 1973. It will result in SA’s prime commercial lending rate dropping from 8.75% to 7.75%. The move comes less than a month after the Sarb announced a 100 basis point cut at its last MPC meeting on March 19. Read: Repo rate slashed by 1% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the @SAReserveBank has decided to cut the repo rate by 100 basis points. This takes the repo rate to 4.25% per annum. — SA Reserve Bank (@SAReserveBank) April 14, 2020  The announcement made on the bank’s Twitter account also comes as the Minister of Finance, Tito Mboweni, is set to address media about the recent rating downgrades by Moody’s and Fitch which are expected to have a severe impact on public finances. The May 2020 meeting of the MPC was moved earlier and took place today. The MPC will host a media briefing today Tuesday 14 April 2020 at 11.30, which will be streamed live on the @SAReserveBank's Facebook and YouTube accounts. — SA Reserve Bank (@SAReserveBank) April 14, 2020   Delivering the emergency monetary policy statement on Tuesday, Reserve Bank governor Lesetja Kganyago, said since the March meeting of the MPC, the Covid-19 pandemic had spread globally, with its impact being felt through all economies. “Current estimates from the International Monetary Fund show global growth contracting by about 2.9% this year. Economic contractions are expected to be deepest in the second quarter of 2020, with some recovery expected in the third quarter of the year,” he said. He warned that the Covid-19 outbreak will have a major health and social impact, and “forecasting domestic economic activity presents unprecedented uncertainty”. Kganyago said in light of this the Sarb now expects South Africa’s 2020 GDP to contract by 6.1%, compared to the -0.2% expected just three weeks ago (at its last MPC meeting in March). The Sarb expects SA’s GDP to grow by 2.2% in 2021 and by 2.7% in 2022. Independent economist, Mike Schüssler, told Moneyweb that the rate cut takes the repo to a record 4-year low. “The last time the repo rate was this low was in 1973, but the real shocker is the Sarb’s latest prediction that the economy will contract by 6.1% in 2020,” he said. “Such a contraction in GDP, will mean it will be SA’s worse economic performance since 1931,” Schüssler pointed out.

Both the supply and demand effects of this extension reduce growth and deepen it in the short term, as businesses stay shut for longer and households with income spend less,” said Kganyago. “This will likely also increase job losses, with further consequences for aggregate demand. The impacts will be particularly severe for small businesses, and individuals with earnings in the informal sector,” he added.

However, at its recent Monetary Policy Review meeting, the bank noted that up to 370 000 jobs could be lost as a result of the initial 21-day lockdown alone.

The local currency was trading at around R18 to the greenback when markets opened, however, it weakened to R18.31 by 13h00 time. Read: South Africa’s rand dips after surprise rate cut
