Zimbabwe’s Health Minister Obadiah Moyo was released on bail after appearing in court on Saturday following his arrest by the country’s anti-corruption authority as part of an investigation into a health-equipment deal. Moyo appeared in court in the capital, Harare, where he was granted bail for Z$50 000 ($2 000), after his detention on Friday. Bail conditions included regular reporting to the authorities and surrendering his passport; the case was adjourned to July 31. No plea was entered. He’s charged with criminal abuse of office over the unlawful procurement of $75 million worth of medical equipment related to the coronavirus, according to court filings seen by Bloomberg. Calls to his phone have so far gone unanswered, and he left the courthouse without speaking to reporters. The Zimbabwe Independent, a Harare-based newspaper, reported on Friday that the authorities are investigating a deal to supply materials to the government for the management of the pandemic at inflated prices. © 2020 Bloomberg
