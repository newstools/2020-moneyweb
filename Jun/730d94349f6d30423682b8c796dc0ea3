 Though nobody was betting that June wouldn’t produce its own trials and turns at some point, the manner of last week’s risk-asset retreat has left investors trying to decipher whether it’s a sign of things to come or just an opportunity to reflect on the strides taken so far. The MSCI’s emerging-markets stocks index may have dropped back below the 200-day moving average it broke through on June 8 but the gauge’s 1.6% decline over the five days was less than half of the losses in developed markets. A Bloomberg-Barclays measure of local-currency debt slipped just 0.1% after reaching a three-month high, and an MSCI gauge of currencies fell 0.2%.   And the dangers remain manifold, from the possibility that a second wave of coronavirus infections could derail the global recovery to an escalation of US-China tensions in the run-up to America’s November presidential election. A warning by the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un over the weekend that the next action will come from the army will likely add to investors’ caution. Underscoring those anxieties, JPMorgan Chase & Co’s measure of implied volatility for emerging-market currencies rose for the first time in seven weeks. Investors will turn to central-bank decisions this week for clues on the next phase, with the average yield on developing-nation currency bonds still close to an all-time low. Policy makers in Indonesia, Russia and Brazil will probably cut interest rates to bolster their economies, eroding their real yields.
