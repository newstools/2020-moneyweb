To ease the verification and payment of foreign nationals the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) advises that employees provide all the necessary documentation, as the verification process has been shortened. This comes after the department was accused of sidelining foreign national workers in the country for the UIF-Ters benefit. “This was occasioned by the fact that the UIF system identified contributors through the South African ID numbers and foreign nationals had to be verified through interaction with South African Services Revenue (Sars) and the UIF,” the UIF commissioner Teboho Maruping says. He says a lot has been done to shorten the process on the system to ensure that payments are made faster. The UIF commissioner says to ensure that foreign national workers receive their payments in time, they should submit the following documents correctly: Last week the fund said it had paid up to R100 million to 23 000 foreign nationals declared on the database.
