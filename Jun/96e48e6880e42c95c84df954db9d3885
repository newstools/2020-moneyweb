Tiger Brands said on Thursday a court had ruled in favour of compelling third parties to provide information on testing of listeria-causing bacteria. The food producer is fighting a class action lawsuit over its role in the worldâ€™s largest ever listeria outbreak that killed more than 200 people in South Africa in 2018 and was traced back to a factory run by Tiger Brands-owned Enterprise Foods.
