The Covid-19 outbreak has brought about many changes in many industries, and banking is no exception. Financial services have been at the forefront of digital transformation but are still largely held back by legacy systems. Due to the pandemic, banks and fintech companies will need to respond quickly to growing consumer demands for new solutions. Moneyweb editor Ryk van Niekerk and Basalt Technology founderÂ Wayne Zwiers, brought together a panel of local and global experts to discuss the issues and opportunities driving the future of financial services. Panellists include Kenneth Kayser (head of open banking, mobile and e-commerce at Nedbank CIB), Symmie Swil (of Investec Corporate & Investment Bank UK) and Steve Ullman (CFO of My EU Pay).
