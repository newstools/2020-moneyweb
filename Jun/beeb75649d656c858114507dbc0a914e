Indebted South African sugar producer Tongaat Hulett said on Wednesday it would sell a sugarcane farm in eSwatini to the countryâ€™s public pension fund for R375 million ($21.83 million). The move is part of an effort by Tongaat to cut its debt by R8.1 billion by selling assets, cutting costs and potentially even raising capital.
