Sun International , the owner of South Africa’s Sun City resort, has received an offer for a 50.1% stake in the hotel and casino operator from Chilean investment firm Nueva Inversiones Pacifico Sur (IPS), lifting its shares by 22%. IPS’ R22 a share offer comes as Sun plans to raise R1.2 billion through a rights issue to boost liquidity and strengthen its balance sheet after the coronavirus lockdown. Chile’s IPS said in a statement on Wednesday that its proposed part-cash offer also includes a bridge loan of up to R1.2 billion to Sun International, which is preparing to reopen its resorts after the lockdown. It said the offer, which values the stake at R1.5 billion, represented a premium of 44.26% to Sun’s June 22 closing share price of R15.25. Shares in Sun International jumped 22.13% to R18.10 after the offer was announced. Sun International was not immediately available for comment. IPS, which already owns about 35% of Sun Dreams SA, the Latin American subsidiary of Sun International, said the proposed offer would provide Sun International shareholders with an attractive alternative to the proposed rights issue, which it also intends to support and underwrite at least 50.1% of. “We believe Sun International has an attractive portfolio of properties in Africa and Latin America which need to be protected against the devastating economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic,” IPS Co-founder and Chairman, Claudio Fischer said in a statement. Value Capital Partners (VCP), the second largest shareholder in Sun International, with a 20.23% stake, opposed the offer, with CEO Sam Sithole saying it “significantly” undervalues the firm. “VCP..do not believe a sale of the business at artificially depressed prices is in the interest of existing shareholders,” he said.
