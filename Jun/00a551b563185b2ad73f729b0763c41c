The majority of South African Airways (SAA) creditors have decided to postpone the vote on the airline’s business rescue plan to July 14, despite concerns raised by the business rescue practitioners (BRPs) that this would be detrimental to the company. Sixty-nine percent of the creditors voted in favour of the adjournment after the National Union of Metal Workers of South Africa (Numsa), the South African Cabin Crew Association (Sacca), and the South African Airways Pilots Association (Saapa) – which represent that majority of workers at the airline – called for amendments to parts of the rescue plan. The unions said they cannot support the plan in its current form, arguing that it is deficient because it does not comply with the Companies Act or the Labour Relations Act. Regional airline SA Airlink also proposed a postponement of the vote on the basis that the plan be amended to introduce key information needed to for it to be considered. SA Airlink said the BRPs had not complied with the conditions prescribed by the Companies Act when convening a creditors’ meeting.

Prior to the vote, the BRPs stated that the delay in adopting the plan would have a detrimental impact on SAA because this is a necessary step towards securing funding for the airline. They said government has said it will not consider a plan that has not been adopted and that should it be revised, this would require a further extension for government to go through the revised plan. In his budget speech on Wednesday Finance Minister Tito Mboweni made no allocations to SAA, saying any consideration of funding would have to be weighed against other priorities.
