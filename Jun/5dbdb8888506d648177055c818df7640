South African mining output dropped the most since at least 1981 in April, when the first full month of restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic brought almost all economic activity to a halt. Total production decreased 47.3% from a year earlier, compared with an 18% decrease in March, the Pretoria-based Statistics South Africa said on its website Thursday. The median estimate of four economists in a Bloomberg survey was for a contraction of 59.4%. Output fell 34.1% in the month.  © 2020 Bloomberg
