South Africaâ€™s trade balance swung to a surplus of R15.94 billion ($918.20 million) in May from a revised deficit of R35.95 billion in April, data from the revenue service showed on Tuesday. Exports jumped 96.1% on a month-on-month basis to R101.85 billion, while imports were down 2.2% to R85.91 billion, the South African Revenue Service said. A strict coronavirus lockdown from late March has been partially eased to allow key sectors like mining to resume operations.
