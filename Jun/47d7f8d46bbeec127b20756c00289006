The event will feature in-depth debate on the latest developments around finance, sustainable infrastructure and the impact of new technology before drilling more deeply into specific sectors, including energy, cities and transport, with case studies showcasing ground-breaking projects, advanced technologies and emerging funding structures. Another key feature will be the “Marketplace”, a networking platform for leaders in infrastructure to pitch their ideas, projects or solutions to stakeholders across the value chain. The economic fallout caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has created an opportunity for key role players in the infrastructure universe to stimulate the economy through infrastructure investment. This will boost the economy in the short-term, and in the long-term provide societal benefits such as employment and spatial integration. The World Economic Forum highlights that when 1% of GDP is invested in infrastructure, economic output increases by about 0.4% in the same year and by 1.5% four years later. The Sidssa seeks to, inter alia, create a sustainable and unique structured approach, that galvanises funders, policy makers, SOEs, and private sector to address fundamental challenges with regards to rebuilding technical and financial engineering capacity in government; development of a detailed and integrated infrastructure investment plan and project pipeline, initiative policy and regulatory reforms to accelerate infrastructure investments, rethink the public sector financing space and revise the public sector infrastructure institutional framework. The symposium will explore these and other key issues under the theme “South Africa’s infrastructure-led economic growth recovery plan post Covid-19″.
