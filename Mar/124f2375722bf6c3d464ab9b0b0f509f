South Africa’s political parties agreed to put aside their differences to contain the spread of the coronavirus, which is wreaking havoc on the economy and threatens to overwhelm the public health system. The truce was declared at a meeting President Cyril Ramaphosa and his deputy, David Mabuza, held with the leaders of opposition parties in Cape Town on Wednesday to discuss the pandemic, which has been declared a national disaster. “Our country finds itself in an extreme situation that requires extraordinary measures,” Ramaphosa said in a statement. “It requires that all South Africans work together in unity and solidarity, in partnership and cooperation.” The unprecedented display of unity comes as the health ministry said 116 people have now tested positive for the disease — more than any other nation in sub-Saharan Africa. The number of confirmed cases has soared since the first patient was diagnosed on March 5, with the first 14 local transmissions confirmed this week. A ban on foreign nationals who traveled to countries with high case counts, including the US, UK, China and Italy, came into effect on Wednesday. More nations may be added to the list based on whether the World Health Organisation considers them high risk, Home Affairs Minister Aaron Motsoaledi told reporters in Cape Town. Schools and universities closed for a month, while 35 of 53 land ports and two sea ports were shut. The government has thus far refrained from confining people to their homes or shuttering restaurants, but warned that more drastic measures may be in the offing.
