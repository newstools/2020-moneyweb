The company’s August 2028 issue slipped 4.6 cents to 100.5 cents on the dollar, its lowest level since January 2019, while the August 2023 issue shed 3 cents, according to Tradeweb data. Eskom resumed nationwide power cuts on Monday, cutting up to 1,000 megawatts (MW) from the grid due to unplanned breakdowns of generating units.
