A fire raging on the slopes of Cape Town’s Table Mountain prompted evacuations in some of the city’s most expensive residential areas as a strong wind fanned the flames and prevented the use of helicopters to battle the blaze. Residents in the suburbs of Higgovale, and Clifton, where a property on Nettleton Road was recently listed at more than $10 million, fled as the fire that started shortly before 1 p.m. local time Sunday approached their houses. #TafelbergRoadFire Fire not contained!!
