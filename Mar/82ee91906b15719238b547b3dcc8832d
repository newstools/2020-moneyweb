There are four cases of Covid-19 at Melrose Arch according to a statement released by the precinct on Wednesday morning. It says that the four patients who have been brought to its attention have self-quarantined. The statement does not mention any details about which companies the patients work for and how and where they were infected. “We are aware of four cases of Covid-19 in the precinct that have been brought to our attention today. All four patients immediately took the precautions as soon as they thought they had contracted the illness and self-isolated themselves or placed in quarantine. The respective companies also implemented measures to ensure the rest of the staff were not at risk.” The precinct says that it has implemented precautionary measures to safeguard against Covid-19, by installing hand sanitiser at the main entrances from the parking basements to the Retail Galleria. It says it has replaced the cleaning products with the World Health Organisation recommended standards-chemicals and will immediately disinfect the precinct, with a disinfectant with a 30-day residual effect. The management of the precinct says it will be guided by advice from health professionals and the Department of Health should there be more cases of Covid-19 reported in the precinct.
