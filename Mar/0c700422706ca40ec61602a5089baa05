The plunge in international oil prices has a potential upside for South Africa’s debt-stricken state power utility. Eskom can’t generate enough power from its coal-fired power stations to meet demand, and burnt through diesel worth R6.5 billion at its open-cycle gas turbines in its last financial year to try and avert or limit power cuts. With the utility expecting supply constraints to persist for at least 18 months, a prolonged fuel price slump will go some way to helping contain its primary energy costs. The price of oil plummeted as much as 32% in rand terms on Monday, and was 19% lower at 11:15 am in Johannesburg, after talks between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia collapsed and Saudi Arabia initiated a price war. The price of crude in rand terms — which determines South Africa’s gasoline prices, which are regulated by the state — has plunged 19% in the past two trading sessions. Eskom supplies about 95% of the electricity used in Africa’s most industrialised economy, has amassed R454 billion worth of debt and isn’t generating enough income to cover its operating and debt-servicing costs. © 2020 Bloomberg L.P.
