South African consumer confidence fell to the lowest level in more than two years in the first quarter and is likely to deteriorate even more as the novel coronavirus disrupts domestic and global economic output. A quarterly index measuring consumer confidence fell to -9 from -7 in the three months ended December, FirstRand Ltd.’s First National Bank said in an emailed statement Monday. That’s the lowest since the third quarter of 2017. The median estimate of four economists in a Bloomberg survey was for -10. © 2020 Bloomberg
