Extracted from the giant brown seaweed, known as Ecklonia maxima, AfriKelp produces a liquid seaweed extract that stimulates growth and strengthens green plants thus increasing crop yield and certainty. When applied to the plan, the bio-stimulant helps plants extract nutrients from the soil more efficiently, supports natural root development and growth while improving water efficiency. RMB Ventures’ Ewan Gray spoke to Moneyweb about joining Afrikelp on its journey to sustainably address some of the risks associated with agriculture as well as promote food security in crops in South Africa and internationally.
