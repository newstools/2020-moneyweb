South Africa‘s Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula said on Wednesday that the country had imposed a “total ban” on cruise ships from March 18 because of risks associated with the coronavirus outbreak. “No passenger vessels will be allowed in our ports. In essence, there is a total ban on cruise ships,” Mbalula told a news conference, adding that the ban would not affect cargo ships arriving in South African ports.
