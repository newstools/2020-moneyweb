South African lender Capitec said on Friday its profit for the year to February 29 would rise by up to 21%, without giving a reason. It said its headline earnings per share – the main profit measure in South Africa – would be between 5,401 cents ($3.44) and 5,538 cents, compared with 4,577 cents a year earlier. Its shares rose following the announcement, but were still 2.17% down at 1222 GMT, and stood at 1,320 cents verses a low of 1,294 cents earlier in the day.
