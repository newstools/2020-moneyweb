Some $1.14 trillion in fiscal support has been pledged or is under consideration as governments around the world rush to contain the coronavirus and shore up financial markets and businesses. Pledges by Germany and France to guarantee hundreds of billions in bank loans boosted the global tally. France will guarantee up to 300 billion euros ($333 billion) of bank loans to prop up businesses most hurt from the virus outbreak, while Germany earlier said as much as 550 billion euros was available from state bank KfW. Some governments have allocated new money for cash handouts and medical care, while several are planning targeted measures like tax breaks and loan support. Bank guarantees have started to take up an increasing share of the aid. Here’s a look at what governments have pledged so far, generally in order of their announcements: © 2020 Bloomberg
