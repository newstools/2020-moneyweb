Mkhize said the patient is a 38-year-old male who had travelled to Italy with his wife. “They were part of a group of ten people and arrived back in South Africa on March 1. “The patient consulted a private general practitioner on March 3, with symptoms of fever, headache, malaise, a sore throat and a cough. The practice nurse took swabs and delivered it to the lab. “The Emergency Operating Centre (EOC) has identified the contacts by interviewing the patient and doctor.” The minister said the patient has been self-isolating since March 3 and that a tracer team has been deployed to KwaZulu-Natal with epidemiologists and clinicians from the NICD. The doctor has also self-isolated. The NICD confirm the case on Twitter, applauding SA’s health systems. We confirm that a suspected case of #COVID19 has tested positive. This is not as a failure but as a success of our health systems to be able to detect and rapidly identify cases. The case has been self-isolated at home since the onset of symptoms and is receiving treatment. — NICD (@nicd_sa) March 5, 2020  On Thursday the institute tweeted that it had tested 181 persons for the virus, of whom 132 ‘met the case definition for persons under investigation’.
