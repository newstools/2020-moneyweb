South Africa confirmed six new coronavirus infections after testing more than 600 potential cases, as the disease spread further in sub-Saharan Africa. Among the South African patients are five travelers who recently returned to the country from Europe this month, the Health Ministry said in a statement Wednesday. Four tested positive in Gauteng province, the nation’s economic heartland, while the other two were found in the provinces of Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. In addition to South Africa’s 13 cases, seven other nations in sub-Saharan Africa now have confirmed infections and several governments are moving toward requiring travelers from affected countries to go into quarantine. Ivory Coast, the world’s biggest cocoa grower, also announced its first case. Elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa: © 2020 Bloomberg
