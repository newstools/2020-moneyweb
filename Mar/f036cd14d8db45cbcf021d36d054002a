The idea is that people pool their funds to own a farm. “Lots of people want to farm, but not everyone can, so we crowd around one farm,” says Shezi, explaining his concept of crowd cattle farming. You buy a cow that is fed and cared for on the farm, so there is no need to actually know anything about raising a cow, but you reap the rewards when the cow gives birth or is sold on the beef market. Being first to market has the advantage of owning the space – Shezi has trademarked the concept of crowd-farming – but it also takes time for investors to trust the concept. Possibly the best thing that could have happened to Shezi was the launch of Fedgroup’s Impact Farming, which allows investors to buy blueberry bushes, beehives and solar panels, which are all farmed for them. With a well-known financial institution entering the space and spending money on advertising, people have become more familiar with the concept of crowd-farming.
