The South African Defence Force (SANDF) has been deployed to assist and support state departments in their efforts to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus outbreak. A memo signed on Sunday and seen by Moneyweb, states the army’s ground forces have been instructed to “prepare, provide and sustain one sub-unit per province” to provide support for state departments from Monday “until the outbreak is contained”. The memo comes as the number of confirmed cases of people with Covid-19 infections surged to 402 on Monday and the nation waits to hear an update from President Cyril Ramaphosa on how the current regulations will be strengthened to mitigate the spread while salvaging the economy.

SANDF would not confirm and refute the authenticity of the memo stating that it would comment once Ramaphosa makes his announcement.

Gauteng will receive two sub-units of which one will be at the City of Tshwane and the other in the City of Johannesburg. SANDF will provide coordinated assistance to the South African Police Service (SAPS) on the ground and ensure that there’s a consistent presence of either law enforcement body. The memo states further that neither force “must be used to the detriment of another” or trespass on another’s authority.
