The markets have once again taken a pounding, with the FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index (Alis) closing down 7.60% to 40 819 points. There was a recovery towards the end of the day as it had fallen as low of 38 784 at 14:45. The selloff continues a downward trend brought by concerns about the economic fallout of the Covid-19 virus, which has infected 162 000 people around the globe and resulted in 6 500 deaths. So far, 62 South Africans have contracted the virus. The Alsi has fallen 32.6% since the beginning of the year. Last Thursday it closed down 9.7% – the biggest single-day drop since 1997. The scale of the selloff has been staggering says Wayne McCurrie, portfolio manager at FNB Wealth and Investment.  “The market panic around the global coronavirus outbreak first hit the JSE around 17 February. The overall Alsi was valued at around R7.3 trillion back then, however, by Friday last week it stood at R5.5 trillion following last week’s rout.” “With the JSE Alsi down more than 10% by 2pm on Monday, the total stock market will have lost another R500 trillion, bringing the total plunge to since mid-February to more than R2.3 trillion.” President Cyril Ramaphosa said government will take drastic measures, which includes the closing of schools, and restrictions on travel and gatherings of more than 100 people, as ways to combat the deadly virus These efforts have not stemmed the fallout in markets, with share prices continuing to slide despite assurances that the cabinet is putting together an economic stimulus package to deal with the detrimental impact from the actions taken to combat the virus.
