Sasol has started a hedging programme as it looks to tackle plummeting prices and a crash in demand for its oil products and chemicals. The shares surged as much as 13%. It hedged about 80% of its synthetic fuel production in the fourth quarter at near $32 a barrel, the South African oil and chemicals producer said Tuesday. It will continue to hedge crude for the next 12 months. Read: Sasol: What happened, and what now? The move follows credit rating downgrades by Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings. The cost of some of Sasol’s floating-rate debt is partly linked “to our credit rating and the revised rating profile will therefore result in an increase in finance costs from existing facilities” by approximately $10 million a year, it said. The stock rose to the highest level in 12 days. The company has had a torrid year so far with the shares slumping 88% as earlier cost overruns and delays to its Lake Charles chemical project in the US were made worse by lower oil prices and the Covid-19 pandemic. Sasol is considered the option of a rights issue in order to meet debt obligations. The company plans to continue running its South African operations for the duration of the country’s 21-day virus lockdown. But some plants will be required to reduce throughput, or potentially shutdown following lower demand, it said. It has about about $2.5 billion of liquidity. © 2020 Bloomberg
