 Mexem Africa is a global introducing broker to Interactive Brokers – the largest US electronic broker, rated #1 Best Online Broker for eight consecutive years by Barron’s. Online trading platform Mexem is leading a quiet revolution in the South African investment industry. It is the first trading platform to offer South African investors globally competitive fees and could force other players in the local market to adapt to the global trend of low-fee – or even no-fee – trading. Mexem can offer South Africans the ability to trade on international markets at a much lower cost thanks to an agreement with Interactive Brokers, the largest trading platform in the US. Itai Liptz discusses that Mexem does not charge any monthly fees – customers only pay when they trade. As a result, the platform is well-suited to individual investors who would like to buy specific offshore shares to hold, instead of trading regularly. About Itai Liptz:
Itai Liptz (MBA in Business Management) is an innovative leader with expansive business management experience in creating, developing and implementing workable business solutions to achieve optimum operational goals. The idea of Mexem was conceived by the CEO, Itai Liptz. Liptz was investigating trading fees across emerging markets and identified South Africa as a market where many investors were being charged hefty fees, especially when they invested offshore. Liptz, in partnership with Interactive Brokers, set out to disrupt the market by offering as good a service, but at a fraction of the prevailing fees. Brought to you by Mexem Africa.
