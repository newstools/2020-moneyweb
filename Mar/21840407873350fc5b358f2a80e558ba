South African franchise restaurant chain Spur Corporation said on Monday it will defer the payment of its 2020 interim dividend until October 5, in order to preserve cash reserves during the nationwide 21-day lockdown period. “This precautionary act will give the company greater balance sheet flexibility as the situation develops over the coming weeks and months,” Spur said in a statement. The interim dividend amounts to R71 million and was due to be paid on April 6 to shareholders, the owner of Spur Steak Ranches restaurants and fast-food RocoMamas burger chain said. All the group’s restaurants operating in South Africa ceased trading on Thursday, while similar measures have been, or are expected to be, implemented at many of the group’s overseas operations. Spur has over 600 outlets, with restaurants in various parts of Africa, Mauritius, the Middle East and Australasia.
