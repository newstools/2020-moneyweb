South African bank stocks plunged by the most on record as a battering for the rand stemming from the coronavirus crisis combined with a bleak economic outlook to send the sector tumbling. An index of bank stocks sank 15% by the close in Johannesburg. The rand slumped as much as 2.9%, breaching its lowest level against the dollar on record, as investors priced in the probability of a central-bank rate cut Thursday to support the economy. Yields on 10-year government bonds also climbed to an all-time high.  Capitec sank 28%, the most since its 2002 market debut. FirstRand dropped 14% and Standard Bank 13%. Nedbank and Absa slid 12%. Nedbank’s slump was the steepest since 1997, while the other three banks had their worst session since December 2015.
