Facebook is paying all of its 45 000 employees an extra $1 000 to help manage expenses during the Covid-19 outbreak. Chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg announced the decision Tuesday in a memo to workers, earlier reported by The Information. The bonus applies to the social network’s full-time employees, who as of now can’t come into the office for health and safety reasons and therefore won’t have access to their usual catered meals, gyms and other services provided by Facebook. Contract employees won’t be eligible for the payment. Menlo Park, California-based Facebook said that while those workers are also barred from coming into the office, the company will continue to pay them what they’d normally earn, even if they are unable to do their jobs from home. Facebook also said it will continue with a normal performance-review schedule, but all employees will be marked as exceeding expectations, so that workers don’t have to worry about losing their jobs during the pandemic. © 2020 Bloomberg
