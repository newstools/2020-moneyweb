South African Deputy Finance Minister David Masondo says he would support direct central bank purchases of government debt to help fund measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus. “The capacity of our government to raise revenue from tax and borrowing is highly limited,” Masondo said in an interview with the Johannesburg-based Sunday Times newspaper. “Covid-19 and the recent downgrades by the credit-rating agencies have worsened our economic woes. Given our fiscal constraints, I would support the South African Reserve Bank if they decide to directly buy government bonds.” South Africa’s economy could contract by as much as 16.1% this year, depending on how long it takes to contain the coronavirus pandemic and for the economy to recover, Treasury estimates show. Any debt purchased by the central bank would be once-off “special bonds,” and should be treated as a temporary measure with a clear exit plan, he said. Funds from central bank should be used for immediate Covid-19 health-related interventions, public infrastructure, and industrial and agricultural financing as part of economic-recovery measures, Masondo said. South Africa’s central bank announced March 25 it would buy government securities in the secondary market to boost liquidity. Masondo said it’s the “independent decision” of the central bank to decide how much money it supplies. © 2020 Bloomberg L.P.
