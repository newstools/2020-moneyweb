Roger Federer is the world’s highest-paid athlete for 2020 as the Covid-19 pandemic knocked soccer’s Lionel Messi off top spot, according to the annual Forbes list released on Friday (May 29). The Swiss tennis great, owner of a men’s record 20 Grand Slam singles titles, earned $106.3 million dollars in the last 12 months, including $100 million dollars via endorsements, to move up four places and become the first player from his sport to top the list. Soccer players Cristiano Ronaldo ($105 million dollars), Messi ($104 million dollars) and Neymar ($95.5 million dollars) and American basketball player LeBron James ($88.2 million dollars) rounded out the top five. Japan’s Naomi Osaka ($37.4 million dollars), who was ranked 29th on the list, surpassed fellow tennis player Serena Williams ($36 million dollars) as the world’s highest-earning female athlete. Osaka and Williams were the only women on the list.
