Months of concern over rising Covid-19 infection levels may be secondary for investors in coming days as market-moving events and policy decisions take centre stage. China’s annual National People’s Congress starting Friday will likely keep volatility suppressed for developing-nation currencies, despite the prospect of another flareup in tensions between Beijing and Washington. JPMorgan Chase & Co’s measure of implied volatility declined over the past three weeks as history suggests the People’s Bank of China will do what it can to ensure a calm yuan-trading environment during the meeting. Elsewhere, central banks in South Africa, Turkey, Indonesia and Thailand are forecast to cut interest rates again, potentially diminishing carry-trade returns from investments in their currencies. As distressed-debt levels rise across developing economies, Argentina may officially fall into default if the South American nation fails to reach a $65 billion restructuring deal with bondholders by Friday’s deadline. “There are undeniably still plenty of risks out there,” said Trieu Pham, an emerging-market strategist at ING Groep in London. “I continue to remain concerned about emerging-market external vulnerabilities, which would be in the spotlight again if EM currencies come under pressure.” That’s not to say the coronavirus is far from people’s minds after the Federal Reserve issued a warning Friday that stock and other asset prices could suffer significant declines should the pandemic deepen. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who called last week for more government action to prevent lasting economic harm from the virus, will testify before Congress on Tuesday.
