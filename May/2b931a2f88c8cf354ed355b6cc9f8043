Qantas Airways’s plan to start record-breaking commercial flights half-way around the world is on hold because of the coronavirus crisis. “There is huge potential for Project Sunrise but the time is not right now given the impact Covid-19 has had on world travel,” chief executive officer Alan Joyce said on a call with reporters Tuesday, referring to the plan to introduce direct services connecting Sydney with London and New York.  Qantas had planned to start the ultra-long-haul services in 2023 and was well into its preparations. It ran test flights from New York and London to Sydney last year, turning the aircraft into a flying laboratory. Qantas had picked Airbus SE’s A350-1000 to fly the routes and planned to buy as many as 12.
