Eskom, the loss-making state-owned power utility, said it will resume cutting 2 000 megawatts from the South African grid at 9am on Friday until 6am on Monday. “This is due to a shortage of generation capacity and depleted emergency resources, which were used extensively to supplement capacity over the past few days,” Eskom said in a statement it posted on Twitter. “In addition, we are taking out three big units for planned maintenance today.” The power cuts began on Thursday night.
