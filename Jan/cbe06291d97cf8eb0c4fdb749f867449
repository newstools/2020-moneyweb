South African Airways (SAA) could receive some of the funding needed to avert its collapse from the Development Bank of Southern Africa, a state-owned financier, two people familiar with the situation said. While the amount is yet to be decided upon, the national carrier, which is in a local form of bankruptcy protection, needs the money to continue operating. It has already canceled some flights this month after the government missed a deadline to provide R2 billion. Spokespeople for South African Airways and DBSA couldn’t immediately comment. They said they may respond later.
