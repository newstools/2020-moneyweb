Lesotho’s prime minister said he intends to step down, following increased calls for his resignation over the murder of his second wife, which police have linked to the woman he married a month later. Thomas Thabane, 80, was inaugurated as prime minister of the tiny African mountain kingdom two days after his second wife was shot in June 2017. His decision to resign was announced by Communications Minister Thesele Maseribane on Thursday. Earlier this month, court documents showed that the country’s police chief asked Thabane to clarify why his mobile phone number was linked to the crime scene, naming Thabane’s current wife, Maesiah Thabane, as a suspect in the killing. Maesiah has been on the run since the police issued an arrest warrant last week. The opposition on Wednesday said it would organise protests if Thabane doesn’t resign within seven days, while a faction within his All Basotho Convention also urged him to step down. Lesotho, which is surrounded by South Africa, has one of the highest murder rates on the continent. © 2020 Bloomberg L.P.
