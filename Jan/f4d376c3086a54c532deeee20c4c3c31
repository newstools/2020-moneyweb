Electricity supplier Eskom’s struggle to avoid blackouts and to manage its crippling debt combine with a list of economic and government challenges that will test the desire of money managers taking advantage of South Africa’s undervalued bond and equity markets, analysts from the bank said in Johannesburg Thursday. “We are tactically bullish bonds and equities in the first quarter, and then unfortunately the longer-term realities such as the local structural rigidities, skills and labor, Eskom load shedding, lack of consumer and business confidence ultimately leads to the rally petering out,” said Michael Jacks, head of South Africa research for BofA. BofA sees Africa’s most-industrialised economy expanding just 0.8% this year, an even more pessimistic projection than the central bank’s 1.2% forecast. They also foresee the government dragging its feet in making changes needed to spur the economy, with a lack of clear policy direction set to hurt sentiment among consumers, businesses and investors. “Investors are getting impatient and are looking for opportunities elsewhere,” said John Morris, BofA’s ‎South Africa investment strategist. “They want to see reform, but are saying ‘why invest waiting for reform?’ when they can see reform and then invest.”  South Africa’s benchmark index was 0.4% lower as of 9:19 a.m. Friday. Eskom said it will cut 2,000 megawatts from the national grid starting 9 a.m. until 6 a.m. Monday. Here are more views from the BofA analysts and strategists on the outlook for South African assets:
