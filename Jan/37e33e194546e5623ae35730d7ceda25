National Treasury introduced Section 12J legislation into South African tax law in 2009, with the aim of stimulating private investment into small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups across the country to create jobs. The incentive provides that individuals, companies and trusts that invest in compliant 12J venture capital companies (VCCs) will be allowed a 100% deduction against their taxable income in the year they invest, provided that they hold their investments for a minimum of five years. Although introduced more than 10 years ago, investor interest was muted until 2015, when certain favourable amendments to the 12J legislation resulted in a significant uptake among investors. Since then, the asset class has grown from less than R1 billion in assets under management in 2015 to around R8.3 billion in February 2019.
