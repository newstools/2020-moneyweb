Put those 2020 forecasts for emerging markets on hold. The goalposts just moved. The U.S. assassination of Iran’s General Qassem Soleimani has sent such a shudder through risk assets, it’s managed to eclipse much of the optimism stemming from the impending signing of an initial trade deal between the U.S. and China. Middle Eastern stock markets nosedived on Sunday, continuing a selloff that began at the end of last week as news emerged that Soleimani had died in a drone attack ordered by President Donald Trump, raising U.S.-Iran tension to a new level. Developing-nation stocks, currencies and bonds remained on the backfoot on Monday. “The threat of a severe retaliation by Iran will keep investors alert,” ING Groep NV strategists including London-based Chris Turner wrote in a report. “For now, investors remain in wait-and-see mode.” Before Friday, expectations of a phase-one U.S.-China trade deal on Jan. 15 had helped drive emerging-market stocks and currencies to the highest levels since June 2018 and average sovereign yield spreads to their narrowest in more than five years relative to U.S. Treasuries. A Bloomberg survey last month found that the majority of 57 strategists and investors polled forecast 2020 would be another year of positive returns for developing-nation assets. Geopolitics aside, emerging-market investors this week will be watching interest-rate decisions in Peru, Poland, Romania and Israel. Taiwan holds a presidential election on Saturday.
