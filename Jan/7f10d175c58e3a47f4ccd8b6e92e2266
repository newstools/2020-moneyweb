Board chairman Rob Adam resigned last year, citing the pressures of the job. The Department of Mineral Resources and Energy did not give a reason for the board members’ resignation but said a list of names of potential new members had been drawn up. “A list of proposed names for the Necsa board has been finalised for submission to cabinet for concurrence. It is the department’s intention to see a stable Necsa in the current financial year,” the ministry said in a statement.
