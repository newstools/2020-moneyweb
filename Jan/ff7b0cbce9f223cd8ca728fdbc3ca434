Sales increased 2.6% from a year earlier compared with a revised 0.4% growth in October, Pretoria-based Statistics South Africa said in a statement on its website on Wednesday. The median estimate of nine economists was for 0.7% growth. Key insights Nedbank Group Economic Unit said strong retail sales growth is not expected to be sustained in the coming months as household spending will be contained by subdued consumer income growth and a deterioration in consumer confidence. “Today’s figures will boost fourth quarter growth figures as household spending accounts for about 60% of GDP. However, spending may have been brought forward to take advantage of special offers, and general economic conditions remain subdued,” said the bank unit. “The MPC will probably keep interest rates unchanged at 6,5% on Thursday mainly due to concerns over the country’s poor and deteriorating fiscal outlook and its implications for Moody’s sovereign risk rating. However, there is a chance of some easing as inflation continued to surprise on the downside, the rand firmed and economic activity remained poor.” © 2020 Bloomberg L.P.
