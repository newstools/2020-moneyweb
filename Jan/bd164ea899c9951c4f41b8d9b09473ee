The quick recovery in emerging-market bonds this month suggests investors aren’t concerned about a further escalation in Middle East tensions. But those worried about a renewal of hostilities should seek out Russian and Thai exposure and avoid securities from Turkey and South Africa, according to a Bloomberg analysis. A study of the relationship between outsized surges in crude prices and moves in 11 emerging market five-year bond spreads over Treasuries showed countries that are net oil importers and those suffering from twin deficits were more vulnerable. By contrast, economies with a robust current-account surplus and are net oil exporters were less affected by a spike in crude. Turkish and South African spreads followed oil prices higher most consistently, while those in Russia and Thailand moved in the opposite direction most of the time. The analysis covers eight periods from 2012 to 2019 when one-month Brent futures jumped by an average of about 20% in as few as three and as many as 69 days. The US killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and retaliatory airstrikes by Iran on a joint US-Iraqi base sent Brent futures up as much as 8% in four days in early January. Risk assets quickly sold off, with emerging-market bond yields widening in Turkey and South Africa, while tightening in Thailand and South Korea.
