South African maize farmers are expected to plant 9% more of the staple crop in the 2019/2020 season compared with the previous season after favourable rains and weather conditions, a Reuters survey showed on Tuesday. South Africa’s Crop Estimates Committee (CEC) is expected to forecast the planted area at 2.5 million hectares for the crop to be harvested in 2020, up from the 2.3 million hectares planted last season, an average estimate of five traders and analysts surveyed showed. The range of total maize estimates was 2.3 million hectares to 2.6 million hectares. “Despite delays in seasonal rains, the season so far has faired well with rains across the producing regions. This has afforded producers to increase their planting area amid favourable prices,” said Senior Agriculture Economist at FNB, Paul Makube. The survey pegged the crop at 1.39 million hectares of white maize, used mainly for human consumption, and 1.1 million hectares of yellow maize, used mainly in animal feed. The CEC will issue its preliminary forecast for the area planted for the 2020 crop on Wednesday.
