State-owned airline South African Airways has cancelled 53 domestic and 46 international “low demand” flights in February in order to cut costs the airline, which is undergoing business rescue, said on Thursday. Read: Concern that DBSA will divert infrastructure funds to SAA What it means for South African Airways to be in ‘business rescue’ “We are committed to accommodating all affected customers on alternative flights, operated by the airline and its Star Alliance partners. Any inconvenience or delays are intended to be minimal,” said  chief commercial officer Philip Saunders. The airline said travel agents, Alliance partners and relevant stakeholders have been notified of these operational changes. The business rescue practitioners are also reviewing “all third party contracts with the entity, with the intention to cancel any onerous contracts or renegotiate others into commercially acceptable terms,” the airline said in a statement. SAA received a R3.5 billion cash injection this week in the form of a National Treasury-guaranteed loan from the Development Bank of Southern Africa to fund its operations while business rescue practitioners develop a rescue plan which should be completed and presented to creditors by the end of February. “The conservation of cash through various cost reduction measures is critical to running an efficient airline and to create a platform on which a future for a restructured entity can be built.” The R3.5 billion from the DBSA increases the initial R4 billion that government said SAA would need for the business rescue process in December up to R5.5 billion, mainly due to the state’s delays in forking out its portion of the money. Originally the funding was meant to consist of R2 billion of state-guaranteed lending from commercial banks and another R2 billion from the state. After missing a critical deadline to secure the money by January 19, the airline had to unexpectedly cancel flights 28 domestic and 10 international flights merely two days after business rescue practitioners said flights would not be cancelled. This time SAA is warning customers in advance.
