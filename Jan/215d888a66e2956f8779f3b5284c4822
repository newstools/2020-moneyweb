As part of its normal flight consolidation and review processes but also owing to the ongoing business rescue process, cash-strapped South Africa Airways (SAA) has announced 38 domestic and international flight cancellations over the week to save money. In a statement released two hours after travel group Flight Centre warned customers on Twitter that SAA had cancelled a number of flights, the airline said this move was in line with its “usual policy of reviewing flights and consolidating services with low demand”.

Domestic flights between Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town have been affected while internationally selected services to Munich have been cancelled. The airline alluded to the fact that there could be further cancellations in the coming days. “Any operational changes will be communicated to our travel trade partners and customers at the earliest opportunity and passengers will be re-accommodated on other airlines wherever possible.” ‘Re-accommodate’ “SAA is working closely with its sister airline, Mango, to re-accommodate passengers on alternative services operated by both airlines to minimise disruption, and thereby ensure passengers reach their destination as quickly as possible. “SAA will re-accommodate passengers on its services between Johannesburg and Frankfurt as well as London Heathrow. Some passengers travelling to Munich, and others travelling via Munich to other destinations, will be re-accommodated for some of their journey on partner airlines in the Star Alliance to minimise delays,” it said.

The process requires R4 billion, half of which is guaranteed and has been raised from private banks, while the remaining R2 billion is still up in the air. On Sunday evening the Public Enterprises Ministry said it was working with Treasury to find the money.
