Zimbabwe’s central bank governor said on Wednesday annual inflation was expected to sharply fall to 50% by the end of this year, as the bank left the main lending rate unchanged saying it was working to stabilise the exchange rate and prices. The government last year suspended publication of annual inflation data until next month, but economic analysts say the figure reached 525% in December.

He said central bank government subsidies should be financed from the national budget not by the central bank as this would destabilise exchange rates and fuel inflation. Most economists, however, still expect inflation pressures to remain elevated, pointing to higher food prices as a result of a drought last year and poor rains during the current farming season as well as foreign exchange shortages. Zimbabwe is in the grips of its worst economic crisis in a decade, marked by soaring prices and shortages of medicines, fuel and electricity, dashing hopes of a quick recovery under President Emmerson Mnangagwa.
