This year’s Raging Bull awards held in Cape Town on Tuesday were a clear confirmation of how the South African unit trust market is taking on a new character. The accolades were dominated by smaller managers, with boutique house MiPlan emerging as the South African Manager of the year. This award, which is the most prominent of the night, recognises the asset manager that has delivered the best risk-adjusted performance across its range of funds. Allan Gray has earned this accolade for the past three years, but slipped to fourth in the 2020 rankings. The recognition for MiPlan is not only significant in that a smaller house has out-performed its larger competitors across its fund range, but because the firm’s approach is not to chase alpha (high returns). All of its funds are managed to achieve a certain objective. Its MiPlan IP Beta Equity Fund aims to deliver a return only at least equal to the performance of the average local equity fund. Its multi-asset portfolios are targeted at outcomes linked to inflation. MiPlan is also explicitly focused on achieving these outcomes at low cost. The MiPlan IP Beta Equity Fund has an annual management fee of just 0.45%. Equally noteworthy was that another boutique firm – Kagiso Asset Management – took home the most fund awards on the night. In total, its funds won in six categories. Investec Asset Management had the second highest tally with four. The only other repeat winners were Allan Gray, which earned three awards for its bond funds; Truffle, which won twice for the Truffle SCI Income Plus Fund; Long Beach, which took home two awards for its Long Beach Flexible Prescient Fund; and Efficient Select, which was recognised twice for the Select BCI Worldwide Flexible Fund. The offshore manager of the year award, for the firm with the best risk-adjusted performance from its range of international funds, was presented to Nedgroup Investments. This is the fifth consecutive year that the manager has secured this accolade. The full list of winners is below.
