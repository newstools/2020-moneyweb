South Africa‘s rand firmed against the dollar early on Wednesday, as investors awaited retail sales numbers, looking for clues on the health of the economy in the final quarter of last year. Market focus was also on the initial trade deal which U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He were due to sign at the White House at 18:30. The rand traded at 14.3550 per dollar at 08:40, 0.35% firmer than its previous close.

On Thursday, the statistics agency will publish mining production data, while the South African Reserve’s monetary policy committee will announce its interest rate decision after keeping rates on hold at 6.5% at its last meeting.
