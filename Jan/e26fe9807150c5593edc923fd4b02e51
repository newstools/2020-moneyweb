The debt snowballing method is a simple and practical way to do this. How debt snowballing works You may have seen pictures of a snowball rolling down a hill. It starts small, but as it rolls it gathers more snow, growing bigger and bigger as it gains momentum. By the time the snowball reaches the foot of the hill, it’s much, much bigger than when it started. The same basic idea applies to the snowball method, which motivates you through a series of small wins. You start by paying off the smallest debts with higher interest rates, which gives you more funds to pay off the bigger ones.
