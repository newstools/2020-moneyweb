South African retailer The Foschini Group warned on Friday it was likely to post a half-year loss due to the impact of the coronavirus, which forced store closures in its major markets. It was likely to make a headline loss per share of between 78.6 cents ($0.0484) and 131 cents in the six months to September 30, it said, versus a headline earnings per share (HEPS) of 523.9 cents a year earlier.
