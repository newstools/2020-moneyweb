Maluleke, who is a Chartered Accountant (CA SA) and current non-executive chairperson of the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (Saica), has more than 20 years of experience in the private and public sectors. According to Saica’s website, in her position as current deputy AG, she is the first woman to hold this executive position in the AG SA’s more than 100-year history. She was appointed deputy AG in 2014.
