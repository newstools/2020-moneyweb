Eskom needs to cut its debt from a “staggering R488 billion” to R200 billion for it to “achieve independent financial sustainability.” This is the view of André de Ruyter, Eskom Group CEO, who gave the keynote address at The Joburg Indaba on Thursday.

He hinted that such a solution was on the way as he was “encouraged by the positive progress made at Nedlac in this regard.” Read de Ruyter’s full speech here. Read: SA agrees on pact to fix Eskom
