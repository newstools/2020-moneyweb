Speaking to reporters as he left the White House on Wednesday, the president said: “Barron’s fine.” The president announced that he and his wife had contracted Covid-19 on October 2, and he was hospitalised later that day. Melania Trump never required hospital care. “I am happy to report that I have tested negative and hope to resume my duties as soon as I can,” she said in her post. “Along with this good news, I want people to know that I understand just how fortunate my family is to have received the kind of care that we did.” The White House physician, Sean Conley, cleared the president to resume his normal activities on Saturday and he returned to the campaign trail on Monday with a rally in Florida. He rallied Tuesday in Pennsylvania and will visit Iowa on Wednesday.
