According to its latest trading statement, in September 2020 the group’s SA restaurants traded at 73.8% of the turnover they achieved in the same month in 2019, up from 36.5% for July and 56.7% for August. Spur’s share price rose as much as 7.32% to R15.99 after the statement’s release. Spur Steak Ranches achieved restaurant turnover of 72.1% of that in September 2019. The strongest performing brands were The Hussar Grill at 93.7% of prior year turnover and RocoMamas at 86.5%. The group says Pizza and Pasta is showing a slower recovery at 63.2% of turnover. International restaurants traded at 83.9% of September 2019’s turnover. As a whole (with local and international restaurants), the group’s turnover has steadily increased from 14.3% of 2019’s turnover in May to 74.8% in September, with 600 of the group’s 631 restaurants having reopened by the end of the month.
