It’s not immediately clear why Canal+ is building a stake in MultiChoice. TechCentral has reached out to Vivendi for comment. In an e-mailed response to a query from TechCentral, MultiChoice said: “Groupe Canal+ became shareholders in MultiChoice Group in April this year. We received notification that their shareholding has now increased to 6.5%, thereby exceeding the 5% threshold that requires us to inform our shareholders through the JSE, as well as the Takeover Regulation Panel.” It added: “We remain committed to acting in the best interests of all our shareholders and to create sustainable long-term value for them.” — © 2020 NewsCentral Media Duncan McLeod is Editor of TechCentral.
