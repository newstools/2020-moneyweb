South African farmers are expected to plant 5% more hectares of maize in the 2020/21 season, boosted by favourable weather conditions and higher prices, the governmentâ€™s Crop Estimates Committee (CEC) said on Wednesday. The CEC forecast that 2.746 million hectares of maize will be planted for the 2020/21 season. It will comprise 1.686 million hectares for white maize, which is used mainly for human consumption, and 1.059 hectares for yellow maize used primarily as animal feed.
