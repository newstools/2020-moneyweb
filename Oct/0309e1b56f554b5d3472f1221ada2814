Investors are warning against higher volatility and a potentially deeper selloff in risk assets after the news of President Donald Trump and the First Lady testing positive for Covid-19 shattered the calm in global markets Friday. US equity futures slumped as much as 2% and Asian stocks also declined following the announcement. The dollar and the yen climbed as the news stoked risk aversion. VIX October futures jumped almost 12%. Subscribe for full access to all our share and unit trust data tools, our award-winning articles, and support quality journalism in the process.

Asia has political stability and strong technology companies in the north. For people looking to allocate globally, this just makes Asia more attractive.” “There will be another selloff,” Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, analyst at Tellimer, said by phone. “The potential selloff can last for few days. Tech will most vulnerable because there valuations are stretched.” “It might also impact Trump’s chance of getting elected. People are going to go for gold and other safe assets.” Investors will move into haven positioning, according to Halley of Oanda. Expects equities and energy to fall, the US dollar to rally, especially against procyclicals such as the euro and the Aussie. Says gold will also rally. “Investors should hedge themselves against S&P,” said Justin Tang, the head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore. “Most people may still be having their hedges on given what happened in March. A lot depends on what happens in next seven days.” “If Trump goes to ICU it is going to be a big problem but if he is asymptomatic that volatility may get contained.” “This will further lead to dollar weakness as it comes on top of the likely prospect that US stimulus package won’t get approval until after the election,” said Jun Kato, chief market analyst at Shinkin Asset Management. “This may also pressure the Fed to deliver a more dovish tone that would cap US yields and weigh on the dollar.” The yen may climb to 104 per dollar, Kato said. Risk aversion “will boost the dollar’s haven appeal, keeping emerging currencies on the back foot,” according to Mingze Wu, a currency trader at StoneX Group. “We’re just a month to the election so this news does throw the election campaign into a disarray for the Republican Party,” Jingyi Pan, market strategist at IG Asia Pte.
