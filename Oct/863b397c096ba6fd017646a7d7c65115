The document, outlining Zimbabwe’s strategy for the 2021 budget which is set to be delivered at the end of November, said the slowdown in inflation would be thanks to a deepening of the foreign currency auction market, which is expected to aid exchange rate stability. The central bank had previously forecast 2020 annual inflation at 300%. Speaking at a finance ministry event on the budget strategy, finance minister Mthuli Ncube said inflation would fall into single digits as the government continues to keep its deficit below 3% of gross domestic product (GDP). The document forecast a deficit of around 1.23% in 2021. It kept growth figures for this year and next year unchanged, at a contraction of 4.5% and growth of 7.4% respectively. The country remains committed to nurturing credibility in its currency, the Zimbabwe dollar, whose value has plummeted since it was reintroduced last year, the document said.
