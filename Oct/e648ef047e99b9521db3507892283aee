Read: Naspers’s insurance plan – Prosus “Today’s announcement marks another step in Prosus’s continuing creation of shareholder value and reflects its focus on reducing the current discount of the share price to Prosus’s net asset value over time,” it said in a statement. Naspers has long been trying to close a discount between its stock price and that of its underlying assets, including an around 30% stake in Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings . It listed Prosus, which houses that stake and other internet assets, separately in Amsterdam as part of those efforts last year.
