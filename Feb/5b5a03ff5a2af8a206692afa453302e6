International flights bound for Nigeria’s commercial capital, Lagos, are diverting to Ghana’s capital, Accra, over poor visibility and faulty landing equipment, the Aviation Ministry said. British Airways, Delta and Emirate airlines are among international carriers that couldn’t land at the Lagos airport and were diverted to Ghana and Abuja, the West African nation’s capital, according to an emailed statement. Other incoming flights have been rerouted to the airport in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, the ministry said. Qatar airlines applied and has gotten approval to divert its flights to Abuja, the ministry said. A new instrument landing system is being installed to provide a more efficient guide to aircraft into the airport, the authorities said. A seasonal dust haze blowing from the Sahara Desert has reduced visibility across West Africa. © 2020 Bloomberg L.P.
