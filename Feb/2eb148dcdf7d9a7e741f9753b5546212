Angola plans to increase annual diamond production to 22 million carats in 2022, from 19.1 million carats, said Mineral Resources Minister Diamantino Azevedo. The country is also seeking to diversify its economy away from oil and diamonds and is targeting production of minerals including gold, silver, iron ore and manganese. The government has adopted a mining code that’s in line with international norms and clamped down on graft as it seeks to attract new investment, the minister said. “Gone are the days when corruption was accepted practice,” he told delegates. Azevedo was speaking at the African Mining Indaba, the continent’s biggest gathering of one of its most vital industries. © 2020 Bloomberg
