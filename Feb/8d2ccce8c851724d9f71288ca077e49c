The benchmark S&P 500 posted a record closing high on Wednesday as US stocks rallied for a third straight day on encouraging US economic data and waning fears of the financial fallout from the corona virus in China. The Nasdaq also notched a record close but steep losses in Tesla shares limited the index’s advance. The ADP National Employment Report showed private payrolls jumped by 291 000 jobs in January, the most since May 2015, while a separate report showed US services sector activity picked up last month, suggesting the economy could continue to grow moderately this year even as consumer spending slows. The S&P 500 has more than recovered from last week’s steep losses after China boosted liquidity to limit the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak. “There are few alternatives to stocks in this low interest rate environment and as long as the economy shows that it can hang in there, people keep coming back to the market as the place to be invested,” said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey. “Right now, they are more afraid about missing out on the market than they are about a sell-off,” Meckler said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 483.22 points, or 1.68%, to 29 290.85, the S&P 500 gained 37.1 points, or 1.13%, to 3 334.69 and the Nasdaq Composite added 40.71 points, or 0.43%, to 9 508.68. Energy was the best-performing S&P 500 sector, jumping 3.8% along with a rise in crude prices. The healthcare sector climbed 2.0%, led by health insurers as well as by a 17.5% jump in shares of Biogen after the biotech company won a patent ruling on a multiple sclerosis drug. Shares of Tesla cooled off after a huge six-day rally, dropping 17.2% after a senior executive warned that the coronavirus outbreak in China would delay deliveries of Model 3 cars made at its Shanghai plant.
