The outbreak of the coronavirus and China’s efforts to stop the spread mean the economy will grow slower this quarter than first thought, according to economists. Goldman Sachs Group, UBS Group and Macquarie Group are among those cutting their growth forecast for both the first quarter and the full year, while others expect material shocks to gross domestic product. Reflecting the worsening situation, Barclays Bank‘s Jian Chang now sees a worst-case scenario knocking 2.2 percentage points off first-quarter growth, a downgrade from her January 22 call that the impact would be “transitory” and limited to certain sectors.
