Chemicals giant Sasol’s headline earnings per share plummeted 74% to R5.94, for the six months ended December 31, 2019. Adjusted Ebitda fell 27% to R19.6 billion, while cash generated by operating activities was down 21% to R19.6 billion. Sasol ascribed the performance to mostly a weak macroeconomic environment, which resulted in lower margins, and the Lake Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP) being in a ramp-up phase. Its share price was down 8.10% to R196.75 by 11:20. “Earnings decreased by 72% to R4,5 billion compared to the prior period. This resulted from a 9% decrease in the rand per barrel price of Brent crude oil, softer global chemical prices and refining margins, lower productivity at our mining operations and a negative contribution from the LCCP. Our gross margin percentage decreased by 2% compared to the prior period driven by a softer macroeconomic environment negatively impacting supply-demand dynamics especially in our chemicals businesses. Our energy business was impacted by lower crude oil prices as well as lower refining margins due to weaker demand,” it said. No interim dividend was declared to “protect and strengthen” balance sheet. According to a tweet from TimBukOne, Sasol’s share price is now at its lowest level since 2003. Update: Now with latest real-time price added – lowest levels since 2003 using inflation adjusted, constant 2020 Rands … Analysts were abuzz after the results were released. JSE dominated by Sasol’s shocking numbers. Half year numbers reveal massive decline of 74% in headline earnings. Share down near 8% to trade below R200 a share. This takes us back to 2005/6 levels. Market got this one horribly wrong. — David Shapiro (@davidshapiro61) February 24, 2020   Board of Directors Remuneration vs. Share Price SASOL.

We do expect that for the second half of FY20 revenue will match the costs expensed better and that the LCCP will generate positive Ebitda,” Sasol said. “The LCCP negatively impacted earnings by R2,8 billion (Ebitda of R1,1 billion and R1,7 billion in additional depreciation charges). Earnings were further impacted by approximately R2 billion in finance charges for the period as the LCCP units reach beneficial operation. “Total cash fixed cost increased by 10% to R30,5 billion as a result of United States (US) growth costs and inflation. Normalised cash fixed cost* increased by 5,4%, which is within our internal inflation target of 6%.” The period under review saw a number of changes to the board and executive team, the most significant of which was the resignation of joint CEOs, B Nqwababa and SR Cornell, effective November 1 2019.
