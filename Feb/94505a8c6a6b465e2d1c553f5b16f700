Malawian President Peter Mutharika will appeal the Constitutional Court’s annulment of last year’s presidential election. The court overturned the outcome of the May vote on February 3 and ordered a new election be held within five months. The ruling marked only the second time an African nation has annulled a presidential ballot. “We feel that the judgment was a serious miscarriage of justice and an attempt to circumvent the will of the people by removing a democratically elected government,” Mutharika’s spokesman, Mgeme Kalilani, said by phone Wednesday from the capital, Lilongwe. Landlocked Malawi is among the world’s least developed countries with a low life expectancy and high infant mortality. The economy is mainly agrarian, with a largely rural population, and relies on aid from international donors, the World Bank and the IMF. It is Africa’s biggest supplier of burley tobacco, a low-quality variety of the leaf used to fill cigarettes rather than flavor them and the crop accounts for the bulk of its exports. © 2020 Bloomberg
