Grand Parade Investments (GPI), which holds the Burger King franchise in South Africa(BKSA), said on Wednesday Morning it will sell all its stake in the business to Emerging Capital Partners (ECP). Since the announcement, the share price is up 9.09% to R3.60. GPI holds 95.36% of shares in Burger King and it acquired the Master Franchise in 2012. In the last two years, the restaurant has exceeded R1 billion in turnover in 2019 and for the first time- since opening doors in 2013 in Cape Town. It says it will also sell to ECP its wholly-owned Grand Foods Meat Plant, which supplies burger patties to BKSA and other businesses. The sale price in the binding offer will be based on Burger King SA’s enterprise value, or R670m based on a ratio of eight times forward earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA). GPI CEO Mohsin Tajbhai said that the group believes the market had undervalued BKSA. “Our focus last year was to restructure the business and to improve the profitability of our operational food businesses, which we succeeded in doing. At the same time, we took a strategic decision to reduce our operational involvement in BKSA and solicited from various interested firms,” Tajbhai says. Tajbhai says that the offer which they received from ECP exceeded an independent valuation done on the business. “Based on this, the board felt that it was necessary to recommend the offer from ECP. We are proud of what we have built in this incredible brand in South Africa, and are excited to hand the baton to ECP, who are experienced investors in the African restaurant and consumer space,” Tajbhai says. As of June 30, Burger King had 92 restaurants, with a total of 18.6 million customers served in the period compared to 15.6 million in the prior year, it said in its full-year result statement released in September. ECP said in the statement that it had raised $3.2bn (R48bn) in capital, and had completed more than 60 transactions.
