South Africa’s high court in Pretoria on Monday rejected state-owned power utility Eskom‘s application for urgent relief in a dispute with energy regulator Nersa over its 2019-2022 tariff decision, Eskom said. Eskom, which supplies more than 90% of South Africa’s electricity, said Nersa’s decision should be set aside because it incorrectly treated R69 billion of state bailouts when calculating the amount of revenue Eskom should be allowed to recoup via tariffs. Eskom said in a statement that, while the court dismissed the urgency of the application, it indicated that there was merit in its case. More to follow.
