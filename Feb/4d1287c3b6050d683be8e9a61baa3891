The European Union has renewed its arms embargo against Zimbabwe and will maintain a targeted assets-freeze against the state-controlled armaments company, Zimbabwe Defence Industries. The decision takes into account the “situation in Zimbabwe, including the yet to be investigated alleged role of the armed and security forces in human rights abuses,” Council of the European Union said in a statement on its website Monday. Restrictive measures were initially introduced in February 2002, when the council expressed grave concern at the situation in Zimbabwe, in particular with regard to serious human rights violations by the government of then-President Robert Mugabe. The EU renewed its support for the country in economic development, primary health care, and humanitarian assistance. “The council conclusions highlight that the EU stands ready to review the whole range of its policies at any time, when justified, based on developments in the country,” it said. © 2020 Bloomberg L.P.
