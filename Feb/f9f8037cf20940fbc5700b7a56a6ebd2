The Republic of Congo added 170 megawatts to its electricity supply by expanding its main power plant with a third gas turbine amid severe outages in the central African nation. Production capacity of Centrale Electrique du Congo SA, owned 80% by the government and 20% by Eni SpA, has increased to 484 megawatts, officials said at a ceremony Tuesday. The company that supplies about 70% of the country’s electricity already has plans to acquire a fourth turbine, according to Energy Minister Serge Blaise Zoniaba. The power plant near Pointe-Noire, the country’s economic hub, should eventually be able to export electricity in the region, Zoniaba said. The government also plans to improve the performance of high-voltage lines between the two main cities, Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire. © 2020 Bloomberg L.P.
