The mayor of South Africa’s Tshwane municipality, which includes the capital, Pretoria, said he will resign this month to end political wrangling over his continued presence in office. Stevens Mokgalapa, a member of the main opposition Democratic Alliance, has faced pressure to quit since a leaked audio tape indicated that he allegedly disparaged officials in a conversation with a mayoral council member. His own party placed him on leave in December and the Economic Freedom Fighters, which forms part of a loose coalition that governs the city, called for him to go. “I wish to make clear that I have not broken any laws and am confident that I would emerge positively from any assessment of my conduct,” Mokgalapa said in an emailed statement. “But in the end, I have concluded that it is best for the city if I stand down as mayor.” © 2020 Bloomberg L.P.
