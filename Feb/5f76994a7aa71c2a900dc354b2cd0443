South African stock investors appeared little moved by the economic reform pledges in President Cyril Ramaphosa’s state of the nation address, keeping any enthusiasm for the plans in check as they await details and implementation. The benchmark stock index in Africa’s most-industrialised economy edged 0.1% higher as of 2:38 pm in Johannesburg, in line with the broader picture in emerging markets. For many market participants, the next key event will be the country’s budget, due to be presented by Finance Minister Tito Mboweni on February 26. “Domestic stocks are not showing any excitement,” Peter Takaendesa, head of equities at Mergence Investment Managers in Cape Town, said by phone. “And there were not enough details of how the budget will be funded and how quickly that will be done, so this has been received with scepticism from investors.” While Ramaphosa promised progress in his speech on Thursday, he offered only partial detail on key policy areas, including stabilising the electricity sector and debt-stricken state power company Eskom, improving public finances, accelerating economic growth and land reform, Fitch Ratings said. The address scored well in terms of building confidence, but scepticism remains over potential delivery, according to Citigroup Inc.  “Many investors, especially offshore investors, have become weary of the South African government’s promises of reform and it seems they are more comfortable waiting on the sidelines to see if the promises made by government are enacted before making any long-term investment decisions,” said Michele Santangelo, a money manager at Independent Securities in Johannesburg.
