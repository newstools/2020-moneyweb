Emerging markets may take their cue this week from a recovery in commodities and signs China’s efforts to stem the spread of the coronavirus are working. Gauges of stocks, bonds and currencies in developing economies all rose in the five days through Friday as raw materials had their best week this year. China’s Communist Party officials urged the nation to meet its economic targets for 2020 as Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak, reported a slowing rate of new infections. Despite a rally since late January, emerging markets have underperformed stocks and bonds in developed nations. That trend should soon reverse, according to Pictet Asset Management, which oversees almost $600 billion. “Valuations in emerging markets, given what’s going on, are more attractive than developed markets,” Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet in London, said in an interview. MSCI Inc.’s index of emerging equities rose 1.3% last week to pare this year’s loss to 0.8%. Currencies in developing nations strengthened for the first time in four weeks, led by the Mexican peso, South African rand and Russian ruble. Bloomberg’s gauge of commodities rose for the first time since early January. Saudi G-20 Turkey, Indonesia Rates
