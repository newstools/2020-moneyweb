In the latest round of the legal battle between Please Call Me inventor Nkosana Makate and Vodacom, the telecomms giant has been ordered to hand over financial records related to the service, as well as value-added services contracts it had with other service providers, to assist in determining the value of the ground-breaking idea. The North Gauteng High Court said on Monday that it gives Vodacom 21 days to hand over the records so that it will be able to determine how much is owed to Makate. The former employee previously rejected an offer of R47 million in the hope of achieving a R20 billion settlement. The figure reflects a 5% share of an estimated R205 billion in revenue that Makate believes was generated from the Please Call Me service, including interest calculated over an 18-year period in the 20-year battle. Makate approached the courts seeking that Vodacom CEO Shameel Joosub disclose the documents the group relied on to conclude that R47 million was the amount due to him for the idea.

Vodacom is ordered to pay the costs of the action, including costs of two counsel, if applicable, as well as the costs of an expert.
