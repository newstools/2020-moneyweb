The manufacturing production industry slumped by 49,4% y/y in April 2020, Statistics SA announced on Thursday afternoon. The staggering decline comes after most of the sector came to a near standstill during the nationwide alert Level 5 lockdown in April and only partially returned to normal production levels in May. Nicolai Claassen, Stats SA Director of Industry Statistics, describes the impact on the sector as much worse than what was seen during the 2008 financial global crisis.

The biggest contributors to the decline were caused by: Seasonally-adjusted manufacturing production decreased by 16.9% in the three months ended in April 2020 compared with the previous three months. All ten manufacturing divisions reported negative growth rates over this period.
