South Africa’s main stock index retreats 1.2% to its lowest level in more than a week as of 9:30 a.m. in Johannesburg, after the government closed schools for a second time in the face of rising Covid-19 infections. The equities benchmark is down 1% since Monday, set to decline for the first week in four. MTN Group Ltd. surged after the mobile carrier gave an upbeat assessment of first-half performance. The announcement on schools came hours after the South African Reserve Bank cut its benchmark interest rate for the fifth time in 2020 and said it sees the economy contracting by 7.3% this year, even more than its previous estimate.  Global risk-off sentiment also took a hit amid rising concern over escalating Sino-US tensions. China on Friday ordered the US to close its consulate in the southern city of Chengdu, in retaliation to Washington’s decision forcing China to leave its mission in Houston earlier this week. Investors are also concerned that recovery in the world’s largest economy has stalled, with US jobless claims rising for the first time since March. Naspers Ltd., with a 19% weighting on the index, falls 3.1% to provide biggest drag to the index, as partly owned internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. retreats in Hong Kong. © 2020 Bloomberg
