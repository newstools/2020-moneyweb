Dutch shareholder association European Investors-VEB is the first party to publicly endorse Steinhoff’s proposed €1 billion (R19 billion) settlement, which is aimed at bringing an end to a long drawn-out and extremely expensive legal battle. If implemented, the proposed complex settlement will establish a precedent in South Africa by compensating shareholders (referred to as the ‘market purchase claimants’) for losses suffered as a result of a collapse in the value of their shares. If the deal is agreed upon, as proposed, Steinhoff shareholders will get €266 million (R5.1 billion). While the proposal reflects remarkable progress by the Steinhoff board it is still far from final. Not only does the board have to secure agreement from a large number of claimants scattered across the globe, the group’s creditors must also sign off on the proposed settlement. Concerns To be expected, given the complexity and the number of parties involved in the settlement, there are concerns. The most notable of these is that the €1 billion valuation is significantly inflated by the overstatement of the current value of Pepkor shares. The settlement plan is based on paying all claimants 50% in cash and 50% in Pepkor shares, which are valued at R15. Pepkor is currently trading at R10.50 and last traded at R15 in early March ahead of the Covid-19 lockdown. However, the R15 valuation is underpinned by a net asset value of just over R16 a share. Wiese may get R9bn In absolute terms, former Steinhoff International chair Christo Wiese looks set to be the single largest beneficiary of the proposed deal, with a possible total payment of around R9 billion. This compares with his claim of R59 billion and needs to be seen in the context of a R3.4 billion claim Steinhoff has for a loan made to Wiese’s Titan Group in early 2018. In addition, a large portion of any money paid to Wiese is subject to claims by Conservatorium, which is the legal successor to a group of financial institutions that extended a €1.6 billion loan to Wiese in 2016. In a press release issued on Monday, Steinhoff said payment on Wiese’s claims would be subject to a resolution between him and Conservatorium. Wiese is one of three Steinhoff NV ‘contractual’ claimants dealt with in the proposed settlement. The other two are Lancaster 101, which is controlled by Jay Naidoo and the Public Investment Corporation (PIC), and Tekkie Town. Lancaster/PIC are set to get €15 million and Tekkie Town €6 million.

Other parties claiming against Steinhoff SA include former banker GT Ferreira, who is expected to receive a R421 million payment against his R1.5 billion claim, and the Le Toit Trust, which will be awarded R227 million on a claim of around R900 million. In a statement released on Monday, VEB CEO Paul Koster said the proposal is in the best interest of all the parties involved. Eye on the future “It is a positive proposal for injured shareholders which shows Steinhoff’s commitment to resolve those issues in very challenging circumstances,” said Koster, adding that implementation of the proposal would allow Steinhoff to focus on the future, which would be in the best interests of the current Steinhoff shareholders.

One analyst said that securing the necessary backing of the creditors might be the biggest challenge, as it meant that the asset value backing their claims would be reduced by €1 billion. “They might prefer that Steinhoff takes its chances with prolonged legal action, especially if they’re earning a good return on their lockup agreement,” said the analyst. The proposed payment to shareholders was described by one lawyer as “surprising” in the context of the recent high court ruling in which Judge David Unterhalter refused to certify a class action, on the grounds that it would not be successful because South African common law does not provide for claims by shareholders.
