Eskom will be implementing Stage 2 load shedding, from 12:00 to 22:00 on Friday (today). It said the “constrained supply situation” may persist throughout the weekend. In a statement released late on Friday morning, the power utility said this is due to an increase in plant breakdowns exceeding 3 000 MW of capacity. “While five generation units were taken off the grid last night and this morning, a breakdown at the Matimba power station has today resulted in the need for load shedding. Two units at the Arnot power station, as well as a unit each at Kendal, Tutuka and Majuba were taken off the grid last night and this morning. These removed more than 3 000 MW of capacity from the system. The delayed return to service of a generation unit at the Duvha power station has also added significant pressure to the generation system.” Earlier on Friday Eskom had warned of the possibility of power cuts, initially seeing the need for only six hours of load shedding. It has asked the public to reduce electricity usage between 16:00 and 22:00 “to assist us in limiting the incidence of loadshedding. “Over the past two evenings the help of the public assisted us in avoiding the need for load shedding.” Developing story.
