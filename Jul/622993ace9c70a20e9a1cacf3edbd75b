Zimbabwe’s agriculture minister Perrance Shiri died from the Covid-19 infection, becoming the first senior government official to succumb to the pandemic, President Emmerson Mnangagwa said on Thursday. Shiri, a retired general who helped plot a coup that ousted Robert Mugabe in 2017, died on Wednesday. The late liberation war veteran was declared a national hero and will be buried on Friday during a closed ceremony. “Now that it is confirmed that Minister Shiri died of Covid-19, we will follow World Health Organisation regulations on how the funeral should proceed,” Mnangagwa said during a funeral wake at Shiri’s home in Harare. Zimbabwe has recorded 2 879 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 40 deaths.
