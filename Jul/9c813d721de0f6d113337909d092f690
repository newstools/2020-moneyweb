Low volumes. Low volatility. Low conviction. Welcome to emerging markets, mid-year 2020. Not that it’s very different for risk assets in general, but there’s a general acceptance that as long as investors weigh the two opposing forces of global stimulus efforts and rising coronavirus infections, the path toward recovery across the world’s developing economies will remain tentative at best. While implied volatility for emerging-market currencies declined for a third successive week in the five days through Friday, expected swings for stocks fell to the lowest since February. The calm belies the potential turmoil from China’s attempts to tame signs of exuberance in the nation’s equities market or any flare up in tensions between the U.S. and China.  “G-7 central-bank policy will remain the key driver for emerging-market asset performance, with the excess liquidity keeping the backdrop relatively stable,” said Simon Quijano-Evans, chief economist at Gemcorp Capital LLP in London. “That is also helping to counter any idiosyncratic negatives out of individual emerging-market countries, especially with regard to how governments are dealing with the Covid-19 onslaught.” After aggressive interest-rate reductions to shore up their economies against the havoc wrought by the pandemic, central bankers from Russia to South Africa will be considering whether to continue easing this week.
