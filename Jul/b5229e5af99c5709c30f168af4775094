South African public schools will close for a four-week break, with some exceptions, President Cyril Ramaphosa said in an address to the nation on Thursday, as confirmed coronavirus cases rose over 400 000. Ramaphosa said it was important to ensure that schools did not become sites of transmission at a time when the countryâ€™s coronavirus cases are rising at one of the fastest rates in the world.
