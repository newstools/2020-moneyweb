Labour unions and representatives of non-unionised managers and ground staff at South African Airways agreed to accept voluntary-severance packages before the state-owned carrier’s proposed restructuring. Only the South African Airways Pilots Association hasn’t agreed to the plans, and will pursue a parallel process to consult the airline’s administrators, the Department of Public Enterprises said in a statement. Six other unions, including the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa and the South African Airways Cabin Crew Association, endorsed the offer following talks on Tuesday. Read: Government, unions agree to retain 1 000 more employees in new SAA Employees who stand to lose their jobs will be supported by a social plan and skills development programme. Around 1 000 South African Airways staff will be retained and roughly 2 700 jobs will be cut, the department said. Those being dismissed will have access to the voluntary-severance packages after creditors approve the airline’s business rescue plan. SAA was placed in a local form of bankruptcy protection in December. After frequent clashes between the government and administrators over restructuring proposals, a plan was announced last month to avoid liquidation and lay the groundwork for a revamped carrier. The rescue plan would require at least R26.7 billion of state funding. © 2020 Bloomberg
