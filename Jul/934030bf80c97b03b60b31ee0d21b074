Your favourite burger chains will soon be serving more locally-produced cheese. At present, 70% of slice-on-slice cheese in South Africa is imported. East London-based Sundale Dairy currently supplies Burger King and McDonald’s South Africa with imported cheese slices. But following its R70 million investment in a new processed-cheese factory in the East London Industrial Development Zone, the imports will be replaced with local products, once the new facility is up and running. The investment is a joint venture (JV) between Sundale and international processed cheese company Schreiber. The new Sundale Schreiber JV will develop processed cheese for quick-serve restaurants. Sundale Dairy CEO Pierre van Rensburg says it has been in negotiations for three years to get this venture off the ground and says the partnership “is a value-add solution for the local economy”. It aims to deliver 7 000 tonnes of (preservative-free) cheese slices to the African market per annum. He says the partnership with Schreiber creates opportunities for skilled labour in the province for food technologists, process engineers and technicians and is a welcome boost for a sector that relies on export opportunities for sustainability. Van Rensburg adds that the Eastern Cape is in need of this boost, considering development has stagnated for some time. “The environment for investing in East London has not been this good for the last couple of decades. On top of that, the Eastern Cape is now the premier producer of milk nationally, with the biggest factories processing milk.” He says despite the country’s economic outlook amid the pandemic, with many shops shutting their doors and jobs being shed, they are positive this JV will succeed. “We have weighed up the operating environment and effects of the pandemic and are very comfortable to maintain and increase momentum on the project’s investment we have planned.” Read: Agriculture blossoms while the rest of the economy shrivels
