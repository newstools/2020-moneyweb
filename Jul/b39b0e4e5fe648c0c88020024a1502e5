South Africa’s main stock index advanced 1.2% as of 9:39 a.m. in Johannesburg. The benchmark is climbing for a fourth month in a row, rising 3.6% for its best July best performance since 2017 as record bullion prices lift gold producers, and as platinum miners rally amid shortages of palladium and sister metal rhodium, which have persisted as the coronavirus disrupted output.  Friday’s gains lift the benchmark’s gains this week to 1%, leaving it 1.3% lower for the year. © 2020 Bloomberg
