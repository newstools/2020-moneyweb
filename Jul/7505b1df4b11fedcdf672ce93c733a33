Over the last few years South African investors have become increasingly alive to both the diverisifcation and return-enhancement benefits of global property. More and more local fund selectors have been using the asset class as an important component of the offshore exposure in their portfolios. While there are some excellent solutions offered by local asset managers in this space, the market has also been enhanced by the introduction of funds by international firms. To get a picture of how these offerings are performing, Citywire has identified the 10 top-performing global real estate funds over the past three years available to South African investors. They include solutions from both local and international asset managers.
